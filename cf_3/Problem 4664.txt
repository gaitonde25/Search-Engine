b'Mr. Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws. The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to n (n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x892) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x896 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8925 he needs to pay 5 and if n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892 he pays only 1 burle.'
b"As mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89n2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89...\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89nk\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89n (here k is arbitrary, even k\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition ni\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x892 should hold for all i from 1 to k."
b'Ostap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split n in parts.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the total year income of mr. Funt.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 minimum possible number of burles that mr. Funt has to pay as a tax.'
