b'Fox Ciel is playing a mobile puzzle game called "Two Dots". The basic levels are played on a board of size n\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89m cells, like this:'
b''
b'Each cell contains a dot that has some color. We will use different uppercase Latin characters to express different colors.'
b'The key of this game is to find a cycle that contain dots of same color. Consider 4 blue dots on the picture forming a circle as an example. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1,\xe2\x80\x89d2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following condition:'
b'  These k dots are different: if i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89j then di is different from dj.  k is at least 4.  All dots belong to the same color.  For all 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891: di and di\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent if they share an edge. '
b'Determine if there exists a cycle on the field.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n and m (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8950): the number of rows and columns of the board.'
b'Then n lines follow, each line contains a string consisting of m characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.'
b'Output'
b'Output "Yes" if there exists a cycle, and "No" otherwise.'
