b'Let quasi-palindromic number be such number that adding some leading zeros (possible none) to it produces a palindromic string. '
b'String t is called a palindrome, if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left.'
b'For example, numbers 131 and 2010200 are quasi-palindromic, they can be transformed to strings "131" and "002010200", respectively, which are palindromes.'
b"You are given some integer number x. Check if it's a quasi-palindromic number."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer number x (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109). This number is given without any leading zeroes.'
b'Output'
b'Print "YES" if number x is quasi-palindromic. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).'
