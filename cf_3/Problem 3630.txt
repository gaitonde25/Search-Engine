b'Polycarp likes arithmetic progressions. A sequence [a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an][a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an] is called an arithmetic progression if for each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n) the value ai+1\xe2\x88\x92aiai+1\xe2\x88\x92ai is the same. For example, the sequences [42][42], [5,5,5][5,5,5], [2,11,20,29][2,11,20,29] and [3,2,1,0][3,2,1,0] are arithmetic progressions, but [1,0,1][1,0,1], [1,3,9][1,3,9] and [2,3,1][2,3,1] are not.'
b'It follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.'
b'Polycarp found some sequence of positive integers [b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn][b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn]. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by 11, an element can be increased by 11, an element can be left unchanged.'
b'Determine a minimum possible number of elements in bb which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence bb becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.'
b'It is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals 00.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in bb.'
b'The second line contains a sequence b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b"If it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with described operations, print -1. In the other case, print non-negative integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes an arithmetic progression. The only allowed operation is to add/to subtract one from an element (can't use operation twice to the same position)."
