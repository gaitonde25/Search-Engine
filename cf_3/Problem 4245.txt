b'It is well-known that the best decoration for a flower bed in Sweetland are vanilla muffins. Seedlings of this plant need sun to grow up. Slastyona has m seedlings, and the j-th seedling needs at least kj minutes of sunlight to grow up.'
b"Most of the time it's sunny in Sweetland, but sometimes some caramel clouds come, the i-th of which will appear at time moment (minute) li and disappear at time moment ri. Of course, the clouds make shadows, and the seedlings can't grow when there is at least one cloud veiling the sun."
b'Slastyona wants to grow up her muffins as fast as possible. She has exactly C candies, which is the main currency in Sweetland. '

b"Slastyona hasn't decided yet which of the m seedlings will be planted at the princess' garden, so she needs your help. For each seedling determine the earliest moment it can grow up if Slastyona won't break the law and won't spend more candies than she has. Note that each of the seedlings is considered independently."
b'The seedlings start to grow at time moment 0.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n and C (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893\xc2\xb7105,\xe2\x80\x890\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89C\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 the number of caramel clouds and the number of candies Slastyona has.'
b'The next n lines contain three integers each: li,\xe2\x80\x89ri,\xe2\x80\x89ci (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89li\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89ri\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109,\xe2\x80\x890\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ci\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109), describing one caramel cloud.'
b'The next line contains single integer m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893\xc2\xb7105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 the number of seedlings.
