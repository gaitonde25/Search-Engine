b'You are given two integers nn and kk.'
b"Your task is to construct such a string ss of length nn that for each ii from 11 to kk there is at least one ii-th letter of the Latin alphabet in this string (the first letter is 'a', the second is 'b' and so on) and there are no other letters except these. You have to maximize the minimal frequency of some letter (the frequency of a letter is the number of occurrences of this letter in a string). If there are several possible answers, you can print any."
b'You have to answer tt independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'The next tt lines are contain queries, one per line. The ii-th line contains two integers nini and kiki (1\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa4min(ni,26)1\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa4min(ni,26)) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string in the ii-th query and the number of characters in the ii-th query.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt lines. In the ii-th line print the answer to the ii-th query: any string sisi satisfying the conditions in the problem statement with constraints from the ii-th query.'
