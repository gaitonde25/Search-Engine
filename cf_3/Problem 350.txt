b'This is followed by tt lines, each containing a description of one test case. The given strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters and have lengths between 11 and 100100 inclusive.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output on a separate line:'
b'  YES if the string in the corresponding test case is square,  NO otherwise. '
