b'Your University has a large auditorium and today you are on duty there. There will be nn lectures today\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 all from different lecturers, and your current task is to choose in which order ordord they will happen.'
b'Each lecturer will use one marker to write something on a board during their lecture. Unfortunately, markers become worse the more you use them and lecturers may decline using markers which became too bad in their opinion.'
b'Formally, the ii-th lecturer has their acceptance value aiai which means they will not use the marker that was used at least in aiai lectures already and will ask for a replacement. More specifically: '
b"  before the first lecture you place a new marker in the auditorium;  before the ordjordj-th lecturer (in the order you've chosen) starts, they check the quality of the marker and if it was used in at least aordjaordj lectures before, they will ask you for a new marker;  if you were asked for a new marker, then you throw away the old one, place a new one in the auditorium, and the lecturer gives a lecture. "
b"You know: the better the marker\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the easier for an audience to understand what a lecturer has written, so you want to maximize the number of used markers. Unfortunately, the higher-ups watch closely how many markers were spent, so you can't just replace markers before each lecture. So, you have to replace markers only when you are asked by a lecturer. The marker is considered used if at least one lecturer used it for their lecture."
b'You can choose the order ordord in which lecturers will give lectures. Find such order that leads to the maximum possible number of the used markers.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of independent tests.'
b'The first line of each test case contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of lectures and lecturers.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 acceptance values of each lecturer.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print nn integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the order ordord of lecturers which maximizes the number of used markers. The lecturers are numbered from 11 to nn in the order of the input. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
