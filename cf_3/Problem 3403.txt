b'A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "(" and ")". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(", "(" and ")" are not.'
b'Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.'
b'You are given a regular bracket sequence ss and an integer number kk. Your task is to find a regular bracket sequence of length exactly kk such that it is also a subsequence of ss.'
b'It is guaranteed that such sequence always exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, both nn and kk are even) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of ss and the length of the sequence you are asked to find.'
b'The second line is a string ss \xe2\x80\x94 regular bracket sequence of length nn.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single string \xe2\x80\x94 a regular bracket sequence of length exactly kk such that it is also a subsequence of ss.'
b'It is guaranteed that such sequence always exists.'
