b'Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?'
b'Input'
b'The only line of input contains an integer m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.'
b'Output'
b'First print k\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.'
