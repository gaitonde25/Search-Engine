b'Madoka is going to enroll in "TSUNS PTU". But she stumbled upon a difficult task during the entrance computer science exam:'
b'  A number is called good if it is a multiple of dd.  A number is called beatiful if it is good and it cannot be represented as a product of two good numbers. '
b'Notice that a beautiful number must be good.'
b'Given a good number xx, determine whether it can be represented in at least two different ways as a product of several (possibly, one) beautiful numbers. Two ways are different if the sets of numbers used are different.'
b'Solve this problem for Madoka and help her to enroll in the best school in Russia!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of test cases. Below comes their description.'
b'Each test case consists of two integers xx and dd, separated by a space (2\xe2\x89\xa4x,d\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4x,d\xe2\x89\xa4109). It is guaranteed that xx is a multiple of dd.'
b'Output'
b'For each set of input data, output "NO" if the number cannot be represented in at least two ways. Otherwise, output "YES".'
b'You can output each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs", "yEs" will be recognized as a positive answer).'
