b'Moamen was drawing a grid of nn rows and 109109 columns containing only digits 00 and 11. Ezzat noticed what Moamen was drawing and became interested in the minimum number of rows one needs to remove to make the grid beautiful.'
b'A grid is beautiful if and only if for every two consecutive rows there is at least one column containing 11 in these two rows.'
b'Ezzat will give you the number of rows nn, and mm segments of the grid that contain digits 11. Every segment is represented with three integers ii, ll, and rr, where ii represents the row number, and ll and rr represent the first and the last column of the segment in that row.'
b'For example, if n=3n=3, m=6m=6, and the segments are (1,1,1)(1,1,1), (1,7,8)(1,7,8), (2,7,7)(2,7,7), (2,15,15)(2,15,15), (3,1,1)(3,1,1), (3,15,15)(3,15,15), then the grid is:'
b'  '
b'Your task is to tell Ezzat the minimum number of rows that should be removed to make the grid beautiful.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains three integers ii, ll, and rr (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4109). Each of these mm lines means that row number ii contains digits 11 in columns from ll to rr, inclusive.'
b'Note that the segments may overlap.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line, print a single integer kk\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of rows that should be removed.'
b'In the second line print kk distinct integers r1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rkr1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rk, representing the rows that should be removed (1\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n), in any order.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any.'
