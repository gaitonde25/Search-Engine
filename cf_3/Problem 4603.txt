b'This is an interactive problem. In the interaction section below you will find the information about flushing the output.'
b'The New Year tree of height h is a perfect binary tree with vertices numbered 1 through 2h\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 in some order. In this problem we assume that h is at least 2. The drawing below shows one example New Year tree of height 3:'

b"Polar bears love decorating the New Year tree and Limak is no exception. To decorate the tree, he must first find its root, i.e. a vertex with exactly two neighbours (assuming that h\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x892). It won't be easy because Limak is a little bear and he doesn't even see the whole tree. Can you help him?"
b'There are t testcases. In each testcase, you should first read h from the input. Then you can ask at most 16 questions of format "? x" (without quotes), where x is an integer between 1 and 2h\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891, inclusive. As a reply you will get the list of neighbours of vertex x (more details in the "Interaction" section below). For example, for a tree on the drawing above after asking "? 1" you would get a response with 3 neighbours: 4, 5 and 7. Your goal is to find the index of the root y and print it in the format "! y". You will be able to read h for a next testcase only after printing the answer in a previous testcase and flushing the output.'
b"Each tree is fixed from the beginning and it doesn't change during your questions."
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89t\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89500)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b"At the beginning of each testcase you should read from the input a single integer h (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89h\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x897)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the height of the tree. You can't read the value of h in a next testcase until you answer a previous testcase."
