b'Ridbit starts with an integer nn.'
b'In one move, he can perform one of the following operations: '
b'  divide nn by one of its proper divisors, or  subtract 11 from nn if nn is greater than 11. '
b'A proper divisor is a divisor of a number, excluding itself. For example, 11, 22, 44, 55, and 1010 are proper divisors of 2020, but 2020 itself is not.'
b'What is the minimum number of moves Ridbit is required to make to reduce nn to 11?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The only line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output the minimum number of moves required to reduce nn to 11.'
