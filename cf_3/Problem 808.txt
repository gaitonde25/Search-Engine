b"Vika decided that she would stay at no more than one friend's house. Help Vika determine the maximum number of days that she will be able to stay in Bertown."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4500)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b"The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of Vika's friends and the day when Vika comes to Bertown."
b"Then follow nn lines, each containing two integers lili and riri (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4100) denoting the period when Vika can stay at the ii-th friend's house."
b'Output'
b"For each test case, output a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of days that Vika can stay in Bertown (or 00 if none of Vika's friends can host her on day kk)."
