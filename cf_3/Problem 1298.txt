b'Chef Monocarp has just put nn dishes into an oven. He knows that the ii-th dish has its optimal cooking time equal to titi minutes.'
b"At any positive integer minute TT Monocarp can put no more than one dish out of the oven. If the ii-th dish is put out at some minute TT, then its unpleasant value is |T\xe2\x88\x92ti||T\xe2\x88\x92ti|\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the absolute difference between TT and titi. Once the dish is out of the oven, it can't go back in."
b'Monocarp should put all the dishes out of the oven. What is the minimum total unpleasant value Monocarp can obtain?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4200)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'Then qq testcases follow.'
b'The first line of the testcase contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of dishes in the oven.'
b'The second line of the testcase contains nn integers t1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tnt1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the optimal cooking time for each dish.'
b"The sum of nn over all qq testcases doesn't exceed 200200."
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer for each testcase\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum total unpleasant value Monocarp can obtain when he puts out all the dishes out of the oven. Remember that Monocarp can only put the dishes out at positive integer minutes and no more than one dish at any minute.'
