b"Nikolay got a string ss of even length nn, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters 'a' and 'b'. Its positions are numbered from 11 to nn."
b"He wants to modify his string so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'. To achieve that, Nikolay can perform the following operation arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero): choose some position in his string and replace the letter on this position with the other letter (i.e. replace 'a' with 'b' or replace 'b' with 'a'). Nikolay can use no letters except 'a' and 'b'."
b'The prefix of string ss of length ll (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4n) is a string s[1..l]s[1..l].'
b'For example, for the string s=s="abba" there are two prefixes of the even length. The first is s[1\xe2\x80\xa62]=s[1\xe2\x80\xa62]="ab" and the second s[1\xe2\x80\xa64]=s[1\xe2\x80\xa64]="abba". Both of them have the same number of \'a\' and \'b\'.'
b"Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string ss to modify it so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'."
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one even integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)(2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of string ss.'
b"The second line of the input contains the string ss of length nn, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters 'a' and 'b'."
b'Output'
b"In the first line print the minimum number of operations Nikolay has to perform with the string ss to modify it so that every its prefix of even length has an equal amount of letters 'a' and 'b'."
b'In the second line print the string Nikolay obtains after applying all the operations. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.'
