b'You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft kk torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.'
b"Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:"
b'  exchange 11 stick for xx sticks (you lose 11 stick and gain xx sticks).  exchange yy sticks for 11 coal (you lose yy sticks and gain 11 coal). '
b'During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.'
b'Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least kk torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The only line of the test case contains three integers xx, yy and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109; 1\xe2\x89\xa4y,k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4y,k\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least kk torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.'
