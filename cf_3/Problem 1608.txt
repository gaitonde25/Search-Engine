b'You are given an integer nn. In one move, you can either multiply nn by two or divide nn by 66 (if it is divisible by 66 without the remainder).'
b"Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 11 from nn or determine if it's impossible to do that."
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow. '
b'The only line of the test case contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, print the answer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 11 from nn if it's possible to do that or -1 if it's impossible to obtain 11 from nn."
