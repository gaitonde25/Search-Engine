b'Polycarp has nn coins, the value of the ii-th coin is aiai. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.'
b'For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a=[1,2,4,3,3,2]a=[1,2,4,3,3,2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1,2,3],[2,3,4][1,2,3],[2,3,4].'
b'Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of coins.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 values of coins.'
b'Output'
b'Print only one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.'
