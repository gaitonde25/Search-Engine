b'It is raining heavily. But this is the first day for Serval, who just became 3 years old, to go to the kindergarten. Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.'
b'Serval will go to the bus station at time tt, and there are nn bus routes which stop at this station. For the ii-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time sisi minutes, and each bus of this route comes didi minutes later than the previous one.'
b"As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two space-separated integers nn and tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. '
b'Each of the next nn lines contains two space-separated integers sisi and didi (1\xe2\x89\xa4si,di\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4si,di\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.'
b'Output'
b'Print one number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.'
