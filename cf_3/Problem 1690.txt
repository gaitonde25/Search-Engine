b'Johnny\'s younger sister Megan had a birthday recently. Her brother has bought her a box signed as "Your beautiful necklace\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 do it yourself!". It contains many necklace parts and some magic glue. '
b'The necklace part is a chain connecting two pearls. Color of each pearl can be defined by a non-negative integer. The magic glue allows Megan to merge two pearls (possibly from the same necklace part) into one. The beauty of a connection of pearls in colors uu and vv is defined as follows: let 2k2k be the greatest power of two dividing u\xe2\x8a\x95vu\xe2\x8a\x95v\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 exclusive or of uu and vv. Then the beauty equals kk. If u=vu=v, you may assume that beauty is equal to 2020.'
b'Each pearl can be combined with another at most once. Merging two parts of a necklace connects them. Using the glue multiple times, Megan can finally build the necklace, which is a cycle made from connected necklace parts (so every pearl in the necklace is combined with precisely one other pearl in it). The beauty of such a necklace is the minimum beauty of a single connection in it. The girl wants to use all available necklace parts to build exactly one necklace consisting of all of them with the largest possible beauty. Help her!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of necklace parts in the box. Each of the next nn lines contains two integers aa and bb (0\xe2\x89\xa4a,b<220)(0\xe2\x89\xa4a,b<220), which denote colors of pearls presented in the necklace parts. Pearls in the ii-th line have indices 2i\xe2\x88\x9212i\xe2\x88\x921 and 2i2i respectively.'
b'Output'
b'The first line should contain a single integer bb denoting the maximum possible beauty of a necklace built from all given parts.'
b'The following line should contain 2n2n distinct integers pipi (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa42n)(1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa42n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the indices of initial pearls in the order in which they appear on a cycle. Indices of pearls belonging to the same necklace part have to appear at neighboring positions in this permutation (so 14321432 is not a valid output, whereas 21432143 and 43124312 are). If there are many possible answers, you can print any.'
