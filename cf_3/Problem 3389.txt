b'You have nn sticks of the given lengths.'
b'Your task is to choose exactly four of them in such a way that they can form a rectangle. No sticks can be cut to pieces, each side of the rectangle must be formed by a single stick. No stick can be chosen multiple times. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to choose such sticks.'
b'Let SS be the area of the rectangle and PP be the perimeter of the rectangle. '
b'The chosen rectangle should have the value P2SP2S minimal possible. The value is taken without any rounding.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
b'Each testcase contains several lists of sticks, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer TT (T\xe2\x89\xa51T\xe2\x89\xa51) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of lists of sticks in the testcase.'
b'Then 2T2T lines follow \xe2\x80\x94 lines (2i\xe2\x88\x921)(2i\xe2\x88\x921) and 2i2i of them describe the ii-th list. The first line of the pair contains a single integer nn (4\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41064\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of sticks in the ii-th list. The second line of the pair contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4aj\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4aj\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 lengths of the sticks in the ii-th list.'
b'It is guaranteed that for each list there exists a way to choose four sticks so that they form a rectangle.'
b"The total number of sticks in all TT lists doesn't exceed 106106 in each testcase."
b'Output'
b'Print TT lines. The ii-th line should contain the answer to the ii-th list of the input. That is the lengths of the four sticks you choose from the ii-th list, so that they form a rectangle and the value P2SP2S of this rectangle is minimal possible. You can print these four lengths in arbitrary order.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
