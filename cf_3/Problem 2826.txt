b"Recently Vasya learned that, given two points with different xx coordinates, you can draw through them exactly one parabola with equation of type y=x2+bx+cy=x2+bx+c, where bb and cc are reals. Let's call such a parabola an UU-shaped one."
b"Vasya drew several distinct points with integer coordinates on a plane and then drew an UU-shaped parabola through each pair of the points that have different xx coordinates. The picture became somewhat messy, but Vasya still wants to count how many of the parabolas drawn don't have any drawn point inside their internal area. Help Vasya."
b'The internal area of an UU-shaped parabola is the part of the plane that lies strictly above the parabola when the yy axis is directed upwards.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points.'
b'The next nn lines describe the points, the ii-th of them contains two integers xixi and yiyi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the ii-th point. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and that the coordinates do not exceed 106106 by absolute value.'
b'Output'
b'In the only line print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of UU-shaped parabolas that pass through at least two of the given points and do not contain any of the given points inside their internal area (excluding the parabola itself).'
