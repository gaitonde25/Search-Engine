b'You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of n\xe2\x8b\x85mn\xe2\x8b\x85m identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below.'
b'  '
b'The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:'
b'  The pieces are arranged into a grid with nn rows and mm columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece. '
b'Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.'
b'Input'
b'The test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next tt lines contain descriptions of test cases.'
b'Each test case contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output a single line containing "YES" if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle, or "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
