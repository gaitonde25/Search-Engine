b'You are given an unweighted tree with nn vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.'
b'Your task is to choose three distinct vertices a,b,ca,b,c on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between aa and bb, bb and cc, or aa and cc is the maximum possible. See the notes section for a better understanding.'
b'The simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer number nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree. '
b'Next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describe the edges of the tree in form ai,biai,bi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai1\xe2\x89\xa4ai, bi\xe2\x89\xa4nbi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ai\xe2\x89\xa0biai\xe2\x89\xa0bi). It is guaranteed that given graph is a tree.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print one integer resres \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of edges which belong to at least one of the simple paths between aa and bb, bb and cc, or aa and cc.'
b'In the second line print three integers a,b,ca,b,c such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4n and a\xe2\x89\xa0,b\xe2\x89\xa0c,a\xe2\x89\xa0ca\xe2\x89\xa0,b\xe2\x89\xa0c,a\xe2\x89\xa0c.'
b'If there are several answers, you can print any.'
