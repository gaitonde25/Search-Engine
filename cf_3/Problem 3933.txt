b'Carol is currently curling.'
b'She has n disks each with radius r on the 2D plane. '
b'Initially she has all these disks above the line y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8910100.'
b'She then will slide the disks towards the line y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890 one by one in order from 1 to n. '
b'When she slides the i-th disk, she will place its center at the point (xi,\xe2\x80\x8910100). She will then push it so the disk\xe2\x80\x99s y coordinate continuously decreases, and x coordinate stays constant. The disk stops once it touches the line y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890 or it touches any previous disk. Note that once a disk stops moving, it will not move again, even if hit by another disk. '
b'Compute the y-coordinates of centers of all the disks after all disks have been pushed.'
b'Input'
b'The first line will contain two integers n and r (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89r\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89000), the number of disks, and the radius of the disks, respectively.'
b'The next line will contain n integers x1,\xe2\x80\x89x2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89xn (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89xi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the x-coordinates of the disks.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single line with n numbers. The i-th number denotes the y-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk. The output will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most 10\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x896.'
b"Namely, let's assume that your answer for a particular value of a coordinate is a and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if  for all coordinates."
