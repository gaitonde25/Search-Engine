b"International Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday."
b'There are nn candy boxes in the shop for sale. The ii-th box contains didi candies.'
b'Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for kk girls. Each gift will consist of exactly two boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by kk. In other words, two boxes ii and jj (i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j) can be combined as a gift if di+djdi+dj is divisible by kk.'
b'How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes "partially" or redistribute candies between them. '
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number the boxes and the number the girls.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers d1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dnd1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dn (1\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4109), where didi is the number of candies in the ii-th box.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of the boxes Polycarp can give as gifts.'
