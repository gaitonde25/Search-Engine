b'You were dreaming that you are traveling to a planet named Planetforces on your personal spaceship. Unfortunately, its piloting system was corrupted and now you need to fix it in order to reach Planetforces.'
b'  '
b'Space can be represented as the XYXY plane. You are starting at point (0,0)(0,0), and Planetforces is located in point (px,py)(px,py).'
b'The piloting system of your spaceship follows its list of orders which can be represented as a string ss. The system reads ss from left to right. Suppose you are at point (x,y)(x,y) and current order is sisi: '
b'  if si=Usi=U, you move to (x,y+1)(x,y+1);  if si=Dsi=D, you move to (x,y\xe2\x88\x921)(x,y\xe2\x88\x921);  if si=Rsi=R, you move to (x+1,y)(x+1,y);  if si=Lsi=L, you move to (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y). '
b"Since string ss could be corrupted, there is a possibility that you won't reach Planetforces in the end. Fortunately, you can delete some orders from ss but you can't change their positions."
b"Can you delete several orders (possibly, zero) from ss in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces after the system processes all orders?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. The first line in each test case contains two integers pxpx and pypy (\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4px,py\xe2\x89\xa4105\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4px,py\xe2\x89\xa4105; (px,py)\xe2\x89\xa0(0,0)(px,py)\xe2\x89\xa0(0,0))\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of Planetforces (px,py)(px,py).'
b'The second line contains the string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4105: |s||s| is the length of string ss)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the list of orders.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of |s||s| over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print "YES" if you can delete several orders (possibly, zero) from ss in such a way, that you\'ll reach Planetforces. Otherwise, print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
