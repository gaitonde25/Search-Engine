b"Let's denote a kk-step ladder as the following structure: exactly k+2k+2 wooden planks, of which"
b'  two planks of length at least k+1k+1 \xe2\x80\x94 the base of the ladder;  kk planks of length at least 11 \xe2\x80\x94 the steps of the ladder; '
b'Note that neither the base planks, nor the steps planks are required to be equal.'
b'For example, ladders 11 and 33 are correct 22-step ladders and ladder 22 is a correct 11-step ladder. On the first picture the lengths of planks are [3,3][3,3] for the base and [1][1] for the step. On the second picture lengths are [3,3][3,3] for the base and [2][2] for the step. On the third picture lengths are [3,4][3,4] for the base and [2,3][2,3] for the steps. '
b'  '
b'You have nn planks. The length of the ii-th planks is aiai. You don\'t have a saw, so you can\'t cut the planks you have. Though you have a hammer and nails, so you can assemble the improvised "ladder" from the planks.'
b'The question is: what is the maximum number kk such that you can choose some subset of the given planks and assemble a kk-step ladder using them?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries. The queries are independent.'
b'Each query consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of planks you have.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the lengths of the corresponding planks.'
b"It's guaranteed that the total number of planks from all queries doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'Print TT integers \xe2\x80\x94 one per query. The ii-th integer is the maximum number kk, such that you can choose some subset of the planks given in the ii-th query and assemble a kk-step ladder using them.'
b"Print 00 if you can't make even 11-step ladder from the given set of planks."
