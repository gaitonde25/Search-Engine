b"Since Grisha behaved well last year, at New Year's Eve he was visited by Ded Moroz who brought an enormous bag of gifts with him! The bag contains n sweet candies from the good ol' bakery, each labeled from 1 to n corresponding to its tastiness. No two candies have the same tastiness."
b"The choice of candies has a direct effect on Grisha's happiness. One can assume that he should take the tastiest ones\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 but no, the holiday magic turns things upside down. It is the xor-sum of tastinesses that matters, not the ordinary sum!"
b'A xor-sum of a sequence of integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89am is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements: , here  denotes the bitwise XOR operation; more about bitwise XOR can be found here.'
b'Ded Moroz warned Grisha he has more houses to visit, so Grisha can take no more than k candies from the bag. Help Grisha determine the largest xor-sum (largest xor-sum means maximum happiness!) he can obtain.'
b'Input'
b'The sole string contains two integers n and k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891018).'
b'Output'
b'Output one number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the largest possible xor-sum.'
