b'You are given a string ss, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. While there is at least one character in the string ss that is repeated at least twice, you perform the following operation: '
b'  you choose the index ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|s|1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|s|) such that the character at position ii occurs at least two times in the string ss, and delete the character at position ii, that is, replace ss with s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6si\xe2\x88\x921si+1si+2\xe2\x80\xa6sns1s2\xe2\x80\xa6si\xe2\x88\x921si+1si+2\xe2\x80\xa6sn. '
b'For example, if s=s="codeforces", then you can apply the following sequence of operations: '
b'  i=6\xe2\x87\x92s=i=6\xe2\x87\x92s="codefrces";  i=1\xe2\x87\x92s=i=1\xe2\x87\x92s="odefrces";  i=7\xe2\x87\x92s=i=7\xe2\x87\x92s="odefrcs"; '
b'Given a given string ss, find the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the string become unique.'
b'A string aa of length nn is lexicographically less than a string bb of length mm, if: '
b'  there is an index ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4min(n,m)1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4min(n,m)) such that the first i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921 characters of the strings aa and bb are the same, and the ii-th character of the string aa is less than ii-th character of string bb;  or the first min(n,m)min(n,m) characters in the strings aa and bb are the same and n<mn<m. '
b'For example, the string a=a="aezakmi" is lexicographically less than the string b=b="aezus".'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104). Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case is characterized by a string ss, consisting of lowercase Latin letters (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the strings in all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output the lexicographically maximum string that can be obtained after applying a certain sequence of operations after which all characters in the string become unique.'
