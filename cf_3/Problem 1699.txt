b'There are nn athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from 11 to nn from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the athlete number ii has the strength sisi.'
b'You want to split all athletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each athlete must be exactly in one team.'
b'You want the strongest athlete from the first team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the second team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams AA and BB so that the value |max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)||max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)| is as small as possible, where max(A)max(A) is the maximum strength of an athlete from team AA, and min(B)min(B) is the minimum strength of an athlete from team BB.'
b'For example, if n=5n=5 and the strength of the athletes is s=[3,1,2,6,4]s=[3,1,2,6,4], then one of the possible split into teams is: '
b'  first team: A=[1,2,4]A=[1,2,4],  second team: B=[3,6]B=[3,6]. '
b'In this case, the value |max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)||max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)| will be equal to |4\xe2\x88\x923|=1|4\xe2\x88\x923|=1. This example illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams.'
b'Print the minimum value |max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)||max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)|.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. '
b'The first line contains positive integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4502\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of athletes. '
b'The second line contains nn positive integers s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn (1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa41000), where sisi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 is the strength of the ii-th athlete. Please note that ss values may not be distinct.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum value of |max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)||max(A)\xe2\x88\x92min(B)| with the optimal split of all athletes into two teams. Each of the athletes must be a member of exactly one of the two teams.'
