b'After learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found palindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.'
b'Chouti has got two strings AA and BB. Since he likes palindromes, he would like to pick aa as some non-empty palindromic substring of AA and bb as some non-empty palindromic substring of BB. Concatenating them, he will get string abab.'
b'Chouti thinks strings he could get this way are interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single string AA (1\xe2\x89\xa4|A|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|A|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'The second line contains a single string BB (1\xe2\x89\xa4|B|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|B|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Strings AA and BB contain only lowercase English letters.'
b'Output'
b'The first and only line should contain a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of possible strings.'
