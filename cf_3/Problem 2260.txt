b'There are nn lectures and mm seminars to be conducted today at the Faculty of Approximate Sciences. The ii-th lecture starts at aiai and ends at bibi (formally, time of the lecture spans an interval [ai,bi)[ai,bi), the right bound is exclusive). The jj-th seminar starts at pjpj and ends at qjqj (similarly, time of the seminar spans an interval [pj,qj)[pj,qj), the right bound is exclusive).'
b'There are xx HD-projectors numbered from 11 to xx and yy ordinary projectors numbered from x+1x+1 to x+yx+y available at the faculty. Projectors should be distributed in such a way that:'
b'  an HD-projector is used in each lecture;  some projector (ordinary or HD) is used in each seminar;  a projector (ordinary or HD) can only be used in one event at the same moment of time;  if a projector is selected for an event, it is used there for the whole duration of the event;  a projector can be reused in some following event, if it starts not earlier than current event finishes. '
b'You are to find such distribution of projectors, if it exists.'
b"Again, note that the right bound of the event's time range is not inclusive: if some event starts exactly when another event finishes, the projector can be reused (suppose that it is instantly transported to the location of the event)."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa43001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4300) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case starts with a line containing four integers n,m,x,yn,m,x,y (0\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,x,y\xe2\x89\xa43000\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,x,y\xe2\x89\xa4300; n+m>0n+m>0, x+y>0x+y>0) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of lectures, the number of seminars, the number of HD projectors and the number of ordinary projectors, respectively. '
b'The next nn lines describe lectures. Each line contains two integers aiai, bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai<bi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ai<bi\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the start time (inclusive) and finish time (exclusive) of the ii-th lecture. '
b'The next mm lines describe seminars. Each line contains two integers pjpj, qjqj (1\xe2\x89\xa4pj<qj\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4pj<qj\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the start time (inclusive) and finish time (exclusive) of the jj-th seminar.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print YES if it is possible to distribute projectors in order to meet all requirements, or NO otherwise. '
b'In case of positive answer, output one additional line containing n+mn+m integers. The first nn integers should be not less than 11 and not greater than xx, and the ii-th of them should be the index of HD projector used in the ii-th lecture. The last mm integers should be not less than 11 and not greater than x+yx+y, and the jj-th of them should be the index of projector used in the jj-th seminar. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
