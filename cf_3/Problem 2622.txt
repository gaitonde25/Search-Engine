b'Find out if the given picture has single "+" shape.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers hh and ww (1\xe2\x89\xa4h1\xe2\x89\xa4h, w\xe2\x89\xa4500w\xe2\x89\xa4500)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the height and width of the picture.'
b'The ii-th of the next hh lines contains string sisi of length ww consisting "." and "*" where "." denotes the empty space and "*" denotes the non-empty space.'
