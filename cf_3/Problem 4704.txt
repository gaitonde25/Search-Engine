b'This problem has unusual memory constraint.'
b'At evening, Igor and Zhenya the financiers became boring, so they decided to play a game. They prepared n papers with the income of some company for some time periods. Note that the income can be positive, zero or negative.'
b"Igor and Zhenya placed the papers in a row and decided to take turns making moves. Igor will take the papers from the left side, Zhenya will take the papers from the right side. Igor goes first and takes 1 or 2 (on his choice) papers from the left. Then, on each turn a player can take k or k\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891 papers from his side if the opponent took exactly k papers in the previous turn. Players can't skip moves. The game ends when there are no papers left, or when some of the players can't make a move."
b'Your task is to determine the difference between the sum of incomes on the papers Igor took and the sum of incomes on the papers Zhenya took, assuming both players play optimally. Igor wants to maximize the difference, Zhenya wants to minimize it.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains single positive integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x894000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of papers.'
b'The second line contains n integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89105\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105), where ai is the income on the i-th paper from the left.'
b'Output'
b'Print the difference between the sum of incomes on the papers Igor took and the sum of incomes on the papers Zhenya took, assuming both players play optimally. Igor wants to maximize the difference, Zhenya wants to minimize it.'
