b'You are given a tree, which consists of nn vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. '
b'  Example of a tree. '
b'Vertices are numbered from 11 to nn. All vertices have weights, the weight of the vertex vv is avav.'
b'Recall that the distance between two vertices in the tree is the number of edges on a simple path between them.'
b'Your task is to find the subset of vertices with the maximum total weight (the weight of the subset is the sum of weights of all vertices in it) such that there is no pair of vertices with the distance kk or less between them in this subset.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa4200) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree and the distance restriction, respectively.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105), where aiai is the weight of the vertex ii.'
b'The next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain edges of the tree. Edge ii is denoted by two integers uiui and vivi \xe2\x80\x94 the labels of vertices it connects (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi).'
b'It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum total weight of the subset in which all pairs of vertices have distance more than kk.'
