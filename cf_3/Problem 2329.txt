b'Alice is playing a game with her good friend, Marisa.'
b'There are nn boxes arranged in a line, numbered with integers from 11 to nn from left to right. Marisa will hide a doll in one of the boxes. Then Alice will have mm chances to guess where the doll is. If Alice will correctly guess the number of box, where doll is now, she will win the game, otherwise, her friend will win the game.'
b'In order to win, Marisa will use some unfair tricks. After each time Alice guesses a box, she can move the doll to the neighboring box or just keep it at its place. Boxes ii and i+1i+1 are neighboring for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921. She can also use this trick once before the game starts.'
b'So, the game happens in this order: the game starts, Marisa makes the trick, Alice makes the first guess, Marisa makes the trick, Alice makes the second guess, Marisa makes the trick, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, Alice makes mm-th guess, Marisa makes the trick, the game ends.'
b'Alice has come up with a sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ama1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,am. In the ii-th guess, she will ask if the doll is in the box aiai. She wants to know the number of scenarios (x,y)(x,y) (for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n), such that Marisa can win the game if she will put the doll at the xx-th box at the beginning and at the end of the game, the doll will be at the yy-th box. Help her and calculate this number.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm, separated by space (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of boxes and the number of guesses, which Alice will make.'
b'The next line contains mm integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ama1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,am, separated by spaces (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n), the number aiai means the number of the box which Alice will guess in the ii-th guess.'
b'Output'
b'Print the number of scenarios in a single line, or the number of pairs of boxes (x,y)(x,y) (1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n), such that if Marisa will put the doll into the box with number xx, she can make tricks in such way, that at the end of the game the doll will be in the box with number yy and she will win the game.'
