b'Alice and Bob are playing a game on a line with nn cells. There are nn cells labeled from 11 through nn. For each ii from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921, cells ii and i+1i+1 are adjacent.'
b'Alice initially has a token on some cell on the line, and Bob tries to guess where it is. '
b'Bob guesses a sequence of line cell numbers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xkx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xk in order. In the ii-th question, Bob asks Alice if her token is currently on cell xixi. That is, Alice can answer either "YES" or "NO" to each Bob\'s question.'
b'At most one time in this process, before or after answering a question, Alice is allowed to move her token from her current cell to some adjacent cell. Alice acted in such a way that she was able to answer "NO" to all of Bob\'s questions.'
b'Note that Alice can even move her token before answering the first question or after answering the last question. Alice can also choose to not move at all.'
b'You are given nn and Bob\'s questions x1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xkx1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xk. You would like to count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob\'s questions. '
b'Let (a,b)(a,b) denote a scenario where Alice starts at cell aa and ends at cell bb. Two scenarios (ai,bi)(ai,bi) and (aj,bj)(aj,bj) are different if ai\xe2\x89\xa0ajai\xe2\x89\xa0aj or bi\xe2\x89\xa0bjbi\xe2\x89\xa0bj.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cells and the number of questions Bob asked.'
b"The second line contains kk integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xkx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xk (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Bob's questions."
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer, the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob\'s questions.'
