b"You are given a string ss, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'."
b'You have to choose a contiguous substring of ss and remove all occurrences of the character, which is a strict minority in it, from the substring.'
b"That is, if the amount of '0's in the substring is strictly smaller than the amount of '1's, remove all occurrences of '0' from the substring. If the amount of '1's is strictly smaller than the amount of '0's, remove all occurrences of '1'. If the amounts are the same, do nothing."
b'You have to apply the operation exactly once. What is the maximum amount of characters that can be removed?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b"The only line of each testcase contains a non-empty string ss, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. The length of ss doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b"The total length of strings ss over all testcases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase, print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum amount of characters that can be removed after applying the operation exactly once.'
