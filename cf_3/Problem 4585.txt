b'Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.'
b'Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b1,\xe2\x80\x89b2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89bn, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position pi, and if bi equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.'
b'Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.'
b'There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x892n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.'
b'It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contain the integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of skewers.'
b'The second line contains a sequence of integers p1,\xe2\x80\x89p2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89pn (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.'
b'The third line contains a sequence b1,\xe2\x80\x89b2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89bn consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.'
b'Output'
b'Print single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.'
