b'Keshi wants to invite as many people as possible. Find the maximum number of people he can invite to the party so that every invited person would be happy.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.'
b"The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of Keshi's friends."
b'The ii-th of the following nn lines contains two integers aiai and bibi (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi<n)(0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi<n).'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
