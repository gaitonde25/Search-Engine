b'Vasya is a big fish lover, and his parents gave him an aquarium for the New Year. Vasya does not have a degree in ichthyology, so he thinks that filling a new aquarium with eels is a good idea. Unfortunately, eels are predators, so Vasya decided to find out how dangerous this idea was.'
b'Getting into one aquarium, eels fight each other until exactly one fish remains. When two eels fight, the big one eats the smaller one (if their weights are equal, then one of them will still eat the other). Namely, let nn eels be initially in an aquarium, and the ii-th of them have a weight of xixi. Then n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 battles will occur between them, as a result of which, only one eel will survive. In a battle of two eels with weights aa and bb, where a\xe2\x89\xa4ba\xe2\x89\xa4b, eel of weight aa will be eaten and disappear from the aquarium, and eel of weight bb will increase its weight to a+ba+b.'
b'A battle between two eels with weights aa and bb, where a\xe2\x89\xa4ba\xe2\x89\xa4b, is considered dangerous if b\xe2\x89\xa42ab\xe2\x89\xa42a. For a given set of eels, danger is defined as the maximum number of dangerous battles that can occur among these eels if they are placed in one aquarium.'
b'Now Vasya is planning, which eels he wants to put into an aquarium. He has some set of eels (initially empty). He makes a series of operations with this set. With each operation, he either adds one eel in the set, or removes one eel from the set. Vasya asks you to calculate the danger of the current set of eels after each operation.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa45000001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4500000), the number of operations that Vasya makes. The next qq lines describe operations. Each operation has one of two types :'
b'  + x describes the addition of one eel of weight xx to the set (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109). Note that in the set there can be several eels of the same weight.  - x describes the removal of one eel of weight xx from a set, and it is guaranteed that there is a eel of such weight in the set. '
b'Output'
b'For each operation, output single integer, the danger of the set of eels after this operation.'
