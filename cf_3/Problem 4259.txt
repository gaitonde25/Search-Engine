b"It is known that passages in Singer house are complex and intertwined. Let's define a Singer k-house as a graph built by the following process: take complete binary tree of height k and add edges from each vertex to all its successors, if they are not yet present."
b'  Singer 4-house '
b'Count the number of non-empty paths in Singer k-house which do not pass the same vertex twice. Two paths are distinct if the sets or the orders of visited vertices are different. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains single integer k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89400).'
b'Output'
b'Print single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the answer for the task modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.'
