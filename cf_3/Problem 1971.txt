b'The USA Construction Operation (USACO) recently ordered Farmer John to arrange a row of nn haybale piles on the farm. The ii-th pile contains aiai haybales. '
b'However, Farmer John has just left for vacation, leaving Bessie all on her own. Every day, Bessie the naughty cow can choose to move one haybale in any pile to an adjacent pile. Formally, in one day she can choose any two indices ii and jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n) such that |i\xe2\x88\x92j|=1|i\xe2\x88\x92j|=1 and ai>0ai>0 and apply ai=ai\xe2\x88\x921ai=ai\xe2\x88\x921, aj=aj+1aj=aj+1. She may also decide to not do anything on some days because she is lazy.'
b'Bessie wants to maximize the number of haybales in pile 11 (i.e. to maximize a1a1), and she only has dd days to do so before Farmer John returns. Help her find the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile 11 if she acts optimally!'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next 2t2t lines contain a description of test cases \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 two lines per test case.'
b'The first line of each test case contains integers nn and dd (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,d\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n,d\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of haybale piles and the number of days, respectively. '
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of haybales in each pile.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile 11 after dd days if Bessie acts optimally.'
