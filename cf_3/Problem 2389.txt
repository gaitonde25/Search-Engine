b'It is Bubble Cup finals season and farmer Johnny Bubbles must harvest his bubbles. The bubbles are in a rectangular bubblefield formed of NN x MM square parcels divided into NN rows and MM columns. The parcel in ithith row and jthjth column yields Ai,jAi,j bubbles.'
b'Johnny Bubbles has available a very special self-driving bubble harvester that, once manually positioned at the beginning of a row or column, automatically harvests all the bubbles in that row or column. Once the harvester reaches the end of the row or column it stops and must be repositioned. The harvester can pass through any parcel any number of times, but it can collect bubbles from the parcel only once.'
b'Johnny is very busy farmer, so he is available to manually position the harvester at most four times per day. Johnny is also impatient, so he wants to harvest as many bubbles as possible on the first day.'
b'Please help Johnny to calculate what is the maximum number of bubbles he can collect on the first day.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers NN and MM (11 \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 NN, MM \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 NN * MM \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 105105) - the bubblefield size.'
b'Each of the next NN lines contains MM integers. The jthjth element in the ithith line is Ai,jAi,j (00 \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 ai,jai,j \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x89\xa4 109109) \xe2\x80\x94 the yield of the parcel located in the ithith row and the jthjth column.'
b'Output'
b'Output contains one integer number - maximum number of the bubbles Johnny can harvest on the first day.'
