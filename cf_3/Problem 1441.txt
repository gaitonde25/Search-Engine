b'You are given four integers aa, bb, xx and yy. Initially, a\xe2\x89\xa5xa\xe2\x89\xa5x and b\xe2\x89\xa5yb\xe2\x89\xa5y. You can do the following operation no more than nn times:'
b'  Choose either aa or bb and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of aa cannot become less than xx, and value of bb cannot become less than yy. '
b'Your task is to find the minimum possible product of aa and bb (a\xe2\x8b\x85ba\xe2\x8b\x85b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than nn times.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The only line of the test case contains five integers aa, bb, xx, yy and nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,x,y,n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,x,y,n\xe2\x89\xa4109). Additional constraint on the input: a\xe2\x89\xa5xa\xe2\x89\xa5x and b\xe2\x89\xa5yb\xe2\x89\xa5y always holds.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of aa and bb (a\xe2\x8b\x85ba\xe2\x8b\x85b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than nn times.'
