b'BerPhone X is almost ready for release with nn applications being preinstalled on the phone. A category of an application characterizes a genre or a theme of this application (like "game", "business", or "education"). The categories are given as integers between 11 and nn, inclusive; the ii-th application has category cici. '
b'You can choose mm\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of screens and ss\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of each screen. You need to fit all nn icons of the applications (one icon representing one application) meeting the following requirements:'
b'  On each screen, all the icons must belong to applications of the same category (but different screens can contain icons of applications of the same category);  Each screen must be either completely filled with icons (the number of icons on the screen is equal to\xc2\xa0ss) or almost filled with icons (the number of icons is equal to s\xe2\x88\x921s\xe2\x88\x921). '
b'Your task is to find the minimal possible number of screens mm.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of the icons. The second line contains nn integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n), where cici is the category of the ii-th application.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of nn for all test cases in the input does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062\xe2\x8b\x85106.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt integers \xe2\x80\x94 the answers to the given test cases in the order they follow in the input. The answer to a test case is an integer mm\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of screens on which all nn icons can be placed satisfying the given requirements.'
