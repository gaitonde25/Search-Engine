b'Polycarp has 33 positive integers aa, bb and cc. He can perform the following operation exactly once.'
b'  Choose a positive integer mm and multiply exactly one of the integers aa, bb or cc by mm. '
b'Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the sequence of three numbers aa, bb, cc (in this order) forms an arithmetic progression? Note that you cannot change the order of aa, bb and cc.'
b'Formally, a sequence x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xnx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn is called an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number dd (called "common difference") such that xi+1=xi+dxi+1=xi+d for all ii from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921. In this problem, n=3n=3.'
b'For example, the following sequences are AP: [5,10,15][5,10,15], [3,2,1][3,2,1], [1,1,1][1,1,1], and [13,10,7][13,10,7]. The following sequences are not AP: [1,2,4][1,2,4], [0,1,0][0,1,0] and [1,3,2][1,3,2].'
b'You need to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the number tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each of the following tt lines contains 33 integers aa, bb, cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4108).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print "YES" (without quotes) if Polycarp can choose a positive integer mm and multiply exactly one of the integers aa, bb or cc by mm to make [a,b,c][a,b,c] be an arithmetic progression. Print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.'
b'You can print YES and NO in any (upper or lower) case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive answer).'
