b"Polycarp, Arkady's friend, prepares to the programming competition and decides to write a contest. The contest consists of nn problems and lasts for TT minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers aiai and pipi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution."
b"Polycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value ss, and initially s=1.0s=1.0. To solve the ii-th problem Polycarp needs ai/sai/s minutes."
b'Polycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by 10%10%, that is skill level ss decreases to 0.9s0.9s. Each episode takes exactly 1010 minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for ai/sai/s minutes, where ss is his current skill level. In calculation of ai/sai/s no rounding is performed, only division of integer value aiai by real value ss happens.'
b'Also, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for tt minutes, he increases his skill by C\xe2\x8b\x85tC\xe2\x8b\x85t, where CC is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.'
b'Polycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest? It is allowed to solve problems in any order, while training is only allowed before solving the first problem.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tctc (1\xe2\x89\xa4tc\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4tc\xe2\x89\xa420)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tctc test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of problems in the contest.'
b'The second line of the test contains two real values C,TC,T (0<C<100<C<10, 0\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851050\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105), where CC defines the efficiency of the training and TT is the duration of the contest in minutes. Value C,TC,T are given exactly with three digits after the decimal point.'
b'Each of the next nn lines of the test contain characteristics of the corresponding problem: two integers ai,piai,pi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104, 1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa410)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the difficulty and the score of the problem.'
b'It is guaranteed that the value of TT is such that changing it by the 0.0010.001 in any direction will not change the test answer.'
b'Please note that in hacks you can only use tc=1tc=1.'
b'Output'
b'Print tctc integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible score in each test case.'
