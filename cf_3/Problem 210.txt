b'Luis has a sequence of n+1n+1 integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an+1a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an+1. For each i=1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n+1i=1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n+1 it is guaranteed that 0\xe2\x89\xa4ai<n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai<n, or ai=n2ai=n2. He has calculated the sum of all the elements of the sequence, and called this value ss. '
b'Luis has lost his sequence, but he remembers the values of nn and ss. Can you find the number of elements in the sequence that are equal to n2n2?'
b'We can show that the answer is unique under the given constraints.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The only line of each test case contains two integers nn and ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4n<1061\xe2\x89\xa4n<106, 0\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa410180\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa41018). It is guaranteed that the value of ss is a valid sum for some sequence satisfying the above constraints.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the sequence which are equal to n2n2.'
