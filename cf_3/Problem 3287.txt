b'You are given an n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m grid. Each grid cell is filled with a unique integer from 11 to nmnm so that each integer appears exactly once.'
b'In one operation, you can choose an arbitrary cycle of the grid and move all integers along that cycle one space over. Here, a cycle is any sequence that satisfies the following conditions:'
b'  There are at least four squares.  Each square appears at most once.  Every pair of adjacent squares, and also the first and last squares, share an edge. '
b'For example, if we had the following grid:'
b'  '
b'We can choose an arbitrary cycle like this one:'
b'  '
b'To get the following grid:'
b'  '
b'In this particular case, the chosen cycle can be represented as the sequence [1,2,3,6,5,8,7,4][1,2,3,6,5,8,7,4], the numbers are in the direction that we want to rotate them in.'
b'Find any sequence of operations to sort the grid so that the array created by concatenating the rows from the highest to the lowest is sorted (look at the first picture above).'
b'Note you do not need to minimize number of operations or sum of cycle lengths. The only constraint is that the sum of all cycles lengths must not be greater than 105105. We can show that an answer always exists under the given constraints. Output any valid sequence of moves that will sort the grid.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (3\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4203\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa420)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the dimensions of the grid.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains mm integers xi,1,xi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xi,mxi,1,xi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xi,m (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,j\xe2\x89\xa4nm1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,j\xe2\x89\xa4nm), denoting the values of the block in row ii and column jj. '
b'It is guaranteed that all xi,jxi,j are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'First, print a single integer kk, the number of operations (k\xe2\x89\xa50k\xe2\x89\xa50).'
b'On each of the next kk lines, print a cycle as follows:'
b's\xc2\xa0y1\xc2\xa0y2\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0yss\xc2\xa0y1\xc2\xa0y2\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0ys'
b'Here, ss is the number of blocks to move (s\xe2\x89\xa54s\xe2\x89\xa54). Here we have block y1y1 moving to where block y2y2 is, block y2y2 moving to where block y3y3 is, and so on with block ysys moving to where block y1y1 is.'
b'The sum of ss over all operations must be at most 105105.'
