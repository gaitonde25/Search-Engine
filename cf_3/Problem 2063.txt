b"Polycarp is a frequent user of the very popular messenger. He's chatting with his friends all the time. He has nn friends, numbered from 11 to nn."
b'Recall that a permutation of size nn is an array of size nn such that each integer from 11 to nn occurs exactly once in this array.'
b'So his recent chat list can be represented with a permutation pp of size nn. p1p1 is the most recent friend Polycarp talked to, p2p2 is the second most recent and so on.'
b"Initially, Polycarp's recent chat list pp looks like 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n (in other words, it is an identity permutation)."
b'After that he receives mm messages, the jj-th message comes from the friend ajaj. And that causes friend ajaj to move to the first position in a permutation, shifting everyone between the first position and the current position of ajaj by 11. Note that if the friend ajaj is in the first position already then nothing happens.'
b'For example, let the recent chat list be p=[4,1,5,3,2]p=[4,1,5,3,2]: '
b"  if he gets messaged by friend 33, then pp becomes [3,4,1,5,2][3,4,1,5,2];  if he gets messaged by friend 44, then pp doesn't change [4,1,5,3,2][4,1,5,3,2];  if he gets messaged by friend 22, then pp becomes [2,4,1,5,3][2,4,1,5,3]. "
b'For each friend consider all position he has been at in the beginning and after receiving each message. Polycarp wants to know what were the minimum and the maximum positions.'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of Polycarp's friends and the number of received messages, respectively."
b'The second line contains mm integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ama1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,am (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the descriptions of the received messages.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn pairs of integers. For each friend output the minimum and the maximum positions he has been in the beginning and after receiving each message.'
