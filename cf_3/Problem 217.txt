b'Sam is a kindergartener, and there are nn children in his group. He decided to create a team with some of his children to play "brawl:go 2".'
b"Sam has nn power-ups, the ii-th has type aiai. A child's strength is equal to the number of different types among power-ups he has."
b'For a team of size kk, Sam will distribute all nn power-ups to kk children in such a way that each of the kk children receives at least one power-up, and each power-up is given to someone.'
b'For each integer kk from 11 to nn, find the minimum sum of strengths of a team of kk children Sam can get.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105). '
b"The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 types of Sam's power-ups."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For every test case print nn integers.'
b'The kk-th integer should be equal to the minimum sum of strengths of children in the team of size kk that Sam can get.'
