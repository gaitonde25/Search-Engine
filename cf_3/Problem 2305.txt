b'There are nn football teams in the world. '
b'The Main Football Organization (MFO) wants to host at most mm games. MFO wants the ii-th game to be played between the teams aiai and bibi in one of the kk stadiums. '
b'Let sijsij be the numbers of games the ii-th team played in the jj-th stadium. MFO does not want a team to have much more games in one stadium than in the others. Therefore, for each team ii, the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum among si1,si2,\xe2\x80\xa6,siksi1,si2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sik should not exceed 22.'
b'Each team has wiwi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the amount of money MFO will earn for each game of the ii-th team. If the ii-th team plays ll games, MFO will earn wi\xe2\x8b\x85lwi\xe2\x8b\x85l.'
b'MFO needs to find what games in what stadiums they need to host in order to earn as much money as possible, not violating the rule they set.'
b'However, this problem is too complicated for MFO. Therefore, they are asking you to help them.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, mm, kk (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410000\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of teams, the number of games, and the number of stadiums.'
b'The second line contains nn integers w1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wnw1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wn (1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the amount of money MFO will earn for each game of the ii-th game.'
b'Each of the following mm lines contains two integers aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ai\xe2\x89\xa0biai\xe2\x89\xa0bi)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the teams that can play the ii-th game. It is guaranteed that each pair of teams can play at most one game.'
b'Output'
b'For each game in the same order, print titi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4k)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of the stadium, in which aiai and bibi will play the game. If the ii-th game should not be played, titi should be equal to 00.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any.'
