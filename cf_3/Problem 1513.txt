b'Since Boboniu finished building his Jianghu, he has been doing Kungfu on these mountains every day. '
b'Boboniu designs a map for his nn mountains. He uses n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 roads to connect all nn mountains. Every pair of mountains is connected via roads.'
b'For the ii-th mountain, Boboniu estimated the tiredness of doing Kungfu on the top of it as titi. He also estimated the height of each mountain as hihi.'
b'A path is a sequence of mountains MM such that for each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<|M|1\xe2\x89\xa4i<|M|), there exists a road between MiMi and Mi+1Mi+1. Boboniu would regard the path as a challenge if for each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<|M|1\xe2\x89\xa4i<|M|), hMi\xe2\x89\xa4hMi+1hMi\xe2\x89\xa4hMi+1.'
b'Boboniu wants to divide all n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 roads into several challenges. Note that each road must appear in exactly one challenge, but a mountain may appear in several challenges. '
b'Boboniu wants to minimize the total tiredness to do all the challenges. The tiredness of a challenge MM is the sum of tiredness of all mountains in it, i.e. \xe2\x88\x91|M|i=1tMi\xe2\x88\x91i=1|M|tMi. '
b"He asked you to find the minimum total tiredness. As a reward for your work, you'll become a guardian in his Jianghu."

b'Output'
b'Print one integer: the smallest sum of tiredness of all challenges.'
