b'Easy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully.'
b"Summer vacation has started so Alice and Bob want to play and joy, but... Their mom doesn't think so. She says that they have to read some amount of books before all entertainments. Alice and Bob will read each book together to end this exercise faster."
b'There are nn books in the family library. The ii-th book is described by three integers: titi \xe2\x80\x94 the amount of time Alice and Bob need to spend to read it, aiai (equals 11 if Alice likes the ii-th book and 00 if not), and bibi (equals 11 if Bob likes the ii-th book and 00 if not).'
b'So they need to choose some books from the given nn books in such a way that:'
b'  Alice likes at least kk books from the chosen set and Bob likes at least kk books from the chosen set;  the total reading time of these books is minimized (they are children and want to play and joy as soon a possible). '
b"The set they choose is the same for both Alice an Bob (it's shared between them) and they read all books together, so the total reading time is the sum of titi over all books that are in the chosen set."
b'Your task is to help them and find any suitable set of books or determine that it is impossible to find such a set.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'The next nn lines contain descriptions of books, one description per line: the ii-th line contains three integers titi, aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4104, 0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa41), where:'
b'  titi \xe2\x80\x94 the amount of time required for reading the ii-th book;  aiai equals 11 if Alice likes the ii-th book and 00 otherwise;  bibi equals 11 if Bob likes the ii-th book and 00 otherwise. '
b'Output'
b'If there is no solution, print only one integer -1. Otherwise print one integer TT \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum total reading time of the suitable set of books.'
