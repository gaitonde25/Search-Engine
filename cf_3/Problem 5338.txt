b'You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters. '
b'Calculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891.'
b'Recall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two numbers n and m denoting the length of string S and number of first English lowercase characters forming the character set for strings (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000, 2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8926).'
b'The second line contains string S.'
