b'Ilya lives in a beautiful city of Chordalsk.'
b'There are nn houses on the street Ilya lives, they are numerated from 11 to nn from left to right; the distance between every two neighboring houses is equal to 11 unit. The neighboring houses are 11 and 22, 22 and 33, ..., n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 and nn. The houses nn and 11 are not neighboring.'
b'The houses are colored in colors c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn so that the ii-th house is colored in the color cici. Everyone knows that Chordalsk is not boring, so there are at least two houses colored in different colors.'
b'Ilya wants to select two houses ii and jj so that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n, and they have different colors: ci\xe2\x89\xa0cjci\xe2\x89\xa0cj. He will then walk from the house ii to the house jj the distance of (j\xe2\x88\x92i)(j\xe2\x88\x92i) units.'
b'Ilya loves long walks, so he wants to choose the houses so that the distance between them is the maximum possible.'
b'Help Ilya, find this maximum possible distance.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43000003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4300000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities on the street.'
b'The second line contains nn integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the colors of the houses.'
b'It is guaranteed that there is at least one pair of indices ii and jj so that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n and ci\xe2\x89\xa0cjci\xe2\x89\xa0cj.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible distance Ilya can walk.'
