b'There is a country with nn citizens. The ii-th of them initially has aiai money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.'
b"Sometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than xx are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly xx money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt."
b'You know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the numer of citizens.'
b'The next line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial balances of citizens.'
b'The next line contains a single integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of events.'
b'Each of the next qq lines contains a single event. The events are given in chronological order.'
b'Each event is described as either 1 p x (1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4n, 0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109), or 2 x (0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109). In the first case we have a receipt that the balance of the pp-th person becomes equal to xx. In the second case we have a payoff with parameter xx.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the balances of all citizens after all events.'
