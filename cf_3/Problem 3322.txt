b'Find out if it is possible to partition the first nn positive integers into two non-empty disjoint sets S1S1 and S2S2 such that:'
b'gcd(sum(S1),sum(S2))>1gcd(sum(S1),sum(S2))>1 '
b'Here sum(S)sum(S) denotes the sum of all elements present in set SS and gcdgcd means thegreatest common divisor.'
b'Every integer number from 11 to nn should be present in exactly one of S1S1 or S2S2.'
b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4450001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa445000)'
b'Output'
b'If such partition doesn\'t exist, print "No" (quotes for clarity).'
b'Otherwise, print "Yes" (quotes for clarity), followed by two lines, describing S1S1 and S2S2 respectively.'
b'Each set description starts with the set size, followed by the elements of the set in any order. Each set must be non-empty.'
b'If there are multiple possible partitions\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 print any of them.'
