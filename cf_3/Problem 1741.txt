b'This is an interactive problem.'
b"We have hidden an integer 1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109. You don't have to guess this number. You have to find the number of divisors of this number, and you don't even have to find the exact number: your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error is not greater than 7 or its relative error is not greater than 0.50.5. More formally, let your answer be ansans and the number of divisors of XX be dd, then your answer will be considered correct if at least one of the two following conditions is true:"
b' |ans\xe2\x88\x92d|\xe2\x89\xa47|ans\xe2\x88\x92d|\xe2\x89\xa47; 12\xe2\x89\xa4ansd\xe2\x89\xa4212\xe2\x89\xa4ansd\xe2\x89\xa42.'
b'You can make at most 2222 queries. One query consists of one integer 1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41018. In response, you will get gcd(X,Q)gcd(X,Q)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the greatest common divisor of XX and QQ.'
b'The number XX is fixed before all queries. In other words, interactor is not adaptive.'
b"Let's call the process of guessing the number of divisors of number XX a game. In one test you will have to play TT independent games, that is, guess the number of divisors TT times for TT independent values of XX."
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains one integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of games.'
