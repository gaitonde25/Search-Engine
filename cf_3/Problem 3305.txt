b'You are given a tube which is reflective inside represented as two non-coinciding, but parallel to OxOx lines. Each line has some special integer points\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 positions of sensors on sides of the tube.'
b"You are going to emit a laser ray in the tube. To do so, you have to choose two integer points AA and BB on the first and the second line respectively (coordinates can be negative): the point AA is responsible for the position of the laser, and the point BB\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 for the direction of the laser ray. The laser ray is a ray starting at AA and directed at BB which will reflect from the sides of the tube (it doesn't matter if there are any sensors at a reflection point or not). A sensor will only register the ray if the ray hits exactly at the position of the sensor."
b'  Examples of laser rays. Note that image contains two examples. The 33 sensors (denoted by black bold points on the tube sides) will register the blue ray but only 22 will register the red. '
b'Calculate the maximum number of sensors which can register your ray if you choose points AA and BB on the first and the second lines respectively.'
