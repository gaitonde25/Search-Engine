b'You have given tree consist of nn vertices. Select a vertex as root vertex that satisfies the condition below.'
b'  For all vertices v1v1 and v2v2, if distancedistance(rootroot, v1v1) =distance=distance(rootroot, v2)v2) then degreedegree(v1v1) =degree=degree(v2v2), where degreedegree means the number of vertices connected to that vertex, and distancedistance means the number of edges between two vertices. '
b'Determine and find if there is such root vertex in the tree. If there are multiple answers, find any of them.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices.'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers vivi and uiui (1\xe2\x89\xa4vi<ui\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi<ui\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 it means there is an edge exist between vivi and uiui. It is guaranteed that the graph forms tree.'
b'Output'
b'If there is such root vertex exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
