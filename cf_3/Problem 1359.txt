b"Mr. Chanek The Ninja is one day tasked with a mission to handle mad snakes that are attacking a site. Now, Mr. Chanek already arrived at the hills where the destination is right below these hills. The mission area can be divided into a grid of size 1000\xc3\x9710001000\xc3\x971000 squares. There are NN mad snakes on the site, the i'th mad snake is located on square (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi) and has a danger level BiBi."
b'Mr. Chanek is going to use the Shadow Clone Jutsu and Rasengan that he learned from Lord Seventh to complete this mission. His attack strategy is as follows:'
b'  Mr. Chanek is going to make MM clones.  Each clone will choose a mad snake as the attack target. Each clone must pick a different mad snake to attack.  All clones jump off the hills and attack their respective chosen target at once with Rasengan of radius RR. If the mad snake at square (X,Y)(X,Y) is attacked with a direct Rasengan, it and all mad snakes at squares (X\xe2\x80\xb2,Y\xe2\x80\xb2)(X\xe2\x80\xb2,Y\xe2\x80\xb2) where max(|X\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92X|,|Y\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92Y|)\xe2\x89\xa4Rmax(|X\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92X|,|Y\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92Y|)\xe2\x89\xa4R will die.  The real Mr. Chanek will calculate the score of this attack. The score is defined as the square of the sum of the danger levels of all the killed snakes. '
b'Now Mr. Chanek is curious, what is the sum of scores for every possible attack strategy? Because this number can be huge, Mr. Chanek only needs the output modulo 109+7109+7.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers NN MM RR (1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103,0\xe2\x89\xa4R<103)(1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103,0\xe2\x89\xa4R<103), the number of mad snakes, the number of clones, and the radius of the Rasengan.'
b'The next NN lines each contains three integers, XiXi, YiYi, dan BiBi (1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi,Yi\xe2\x89\xa4103,1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4106)(1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi,Yi\xe2\x89\xa4103,1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4106). It is guaranteed that no two mad snakes occupy the same square.'
b'Output'
b'A line with an integer that denotes the sum of scores for every possible attack strategy.'
