More formally, the entrance to the park is located at the square 1. The exits out of the park are located at squares 2n,\xe2\x80\x892n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x892n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 and these exits lead straight to the Om Nom friends' houses.
