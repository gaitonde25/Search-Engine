b'Alice and Bob are playing a game on a matrix, consisting of 22 rows and mm columns. The cell in the ii-th row in the jj-th column contains ai,jai,j coins in it.'
b'Initially, both Alice and Bob are standing in a cell (1,1)(1,1). They are going to perform a sequence of moves to reach a cell (2,m)(2,m).'
b'The possible moves are: '
b'  Move right\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 from some cell (x,y)(x,y) to (x,y+1)(x,y+1);  Move down\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 from some cell (x,y)(x,y) to (x+1,y)(x+1,y). '
b'First, Alice makes all her moves until she reaches (2,m)(2,m). She collects the coins in all cells she visit (including the starting cell).'
b"When Alice finishes, Bob starts his journey. He also performs the moves to reach (2,m)(2,m) and collects the coins in all cells that he visited, but Alice didn't."
b'The score of the game is the total number of coins Bob collects.'
b'Alice wants to minimize the score. Bob wants to maximize the score. What will the score of the game be if both players play optimally?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'Then the descriptions of tt testcases follow.'
b'The first line of the testcase contains a single integer mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of columns of the matrix.'
b'The ii-th of the next 22 lines contain mm integers ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,mai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,m (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of coins in the cell in the ii-th row in the jj-th column of the matrix.'
b"The sum of mm over all testcases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the score of the game if both players play optimally.'
