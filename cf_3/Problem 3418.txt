b'Mrs. Smith is trying to contact her husband, John Smith, but she forgot the secret phone number!'
b'The only thing Mrs. Smith remembered was that any permutation of nn can be a secret phone number. Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband.'
b'The sequence of nn integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 11 to nn exactly once.'
b'The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). '
b'A subsequence ai1,ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aikai1,ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aik where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<ik\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<ik\xe2\x89\xa4n is called increasing if ai1<ai2<ai3<\xe2\x80\xa6<aikai1<ai2<ai3<\xe2\x80\xa6<aik. If ai1>ai2>ai3>\xe2\x80\xa6>aikai1>ai2>ai3>\xe2\x80\xa6>aik, a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences.'
b'For example, if there is a permutation [6,4,1,7,2,3,5][6,4,1,7,2,3,5], LIS of this permutation will be [1,2,3,5][1,2,3,5], so the length of LIS is equal to 44. LDS can be [6,4,1][6,4,1], [6,4,2][6,4,2], or [6,4,3][6,4,3], so the length of LDS is 33.'
b'Note, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.'
b'So please help Mrs. Smith to find a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of permutation that you need to build.'
b'Output'
b'Print a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS. '
b'If there are multiple answers, print any.'
