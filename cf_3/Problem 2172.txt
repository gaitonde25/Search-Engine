b'Gloria likes to play Dota\xc2\xa03, so she wants to buy all nn available relics for her favorite hero.'
b'Relics can be bought using an in-game currency called shards. Each relic has its own price\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 cici shards for the ii-th relic. A player can buy a relic using one of the following options: '
b'  Pay cici shards to buy the ii-th relic;  Pay xx shards and randomly get one of all nn relics. The probability of getting a relic is the same for all nn relics. If a duplicate relic is received, then the relic is recycled and x2x2 shards are given back to the player. '
b'Gloria wants to buy all nn relics. Help her minimize the expected number of shards she spends to buy all the relics.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100; 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa410000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of relics and the cost to receive a random relic.'

b'Output'
b'Print a single real number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum expected number of shards that Gloria must spend to buy all the relics.'
b'The absolute or relative error should not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92910\xe2\x88\x929.'
