b'Two friends are travelling through Bubble galaxy. They say "Hello!" via signals to each other if their distance is smaller or equal than d1d1 and '
b"  it's the first time they speak to each other or   at some point in time after their last talk their distance was greater than d2d2. "
b'We need to calculate how many times friends said "Hello!" to each other. For NN moments, you\'ll have an array of points for each friend representing their positions at that moment. A person can stay in the same position between two moments in time, but if a person made a move we assume this movement as movement with constant speed in constant direction.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer number NN (2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000) representing number of moments in which we captured positions for two friends.'
b'The second line contains two integer numbers d1d1 and d2\xc2\xa0(0<d1<d2<1000)d2\xc2\xa0(0<d1<d2<1000). '
b'The next NN lines contains four integer numbers Ax,Ay,Bx,ByAx,Ay,Bx,By (0\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By\xe2\x89\xa410000\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By\xe2\x89\xa41000) representing coordinates of friends A and B in each captured moment.'
b'Output'
b'Output contains one integer number that represents how many times friends will say "Hello!" to each other.'
