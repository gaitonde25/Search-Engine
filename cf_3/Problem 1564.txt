b'The only difference between easy and hard versions is on constraints. In this version constraints are lower. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.'
b'Koa the Koala is at the beach!'
b'The beach consists (from left to right) of a shore, n+1n+1 meters of sea and an island at n+1n+1 meters from the shore.'
b'She measured the depth of the sea at 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n meters from the shore and saved them in array dd. didi denotes the depth of the sea at ii meters from the shore for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n.'
b'Like any beach this one has tide, the intensity of the tide is measured by parameter kk and affects all depths from the beginning at time t=0t=0 in the following way:'
b"  For a total of kk seconds, each second, tide increases all depths by 11.  Then, for a total of kk seconds, each second, tide decreases all depths by 11.  This process repeats again and again (ie. depths increase for kk seconds then decrease for kk seconds and so on ...).Formally, let's define 00-indexed array p=[0,1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,k\xe2\x88\x922,k\xe2\x88\x921,k,k\xe2\x88\x921,k\xe2\x88\x922,\xe2\x80\xa6,2,1]p=[0,1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,k\xe2\x88\x922,k\xe2\x88\x921,k,k\xe2\x88\x921,k\xe2\x88\x922,\xe2\x80\xa6,2,1] of length 2k2k. At time tt (0\xe2\x89\xa4t0\xe2\x89\xa4t) depth at ii meters from the shore equals di+p[tmod2k]di+p[tmod2k] (tmod2ktmod2k denotes the remainder of the division of tt by 2k2k). Note that the changes occur instantaneously after each second, see the notes for better understanding. "
b'At time t=0t=0 Koa is standing at the shore and wants to get to the island. Suppose that at some time tt (0\xe2\x89\xa4t0\xe2\x89\xa4t) she is at xx (0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n) meters from the shore:'
b"  In one second Koa can swim 11 meter further from the shore (xx changes to x+1x+1) or not swim at all (xx stays the same), in both cases tt changes to t+1t+1.  As Koa is a bad swimmer, the depth of the sea at the point where she is can't exceed ll at integer points of time (or she will drown). More formally, if Koa is at xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n) meters from the shore at the moment tt (for some integer t\xe2\x89\xa50t\xe2\x89\xa50), the depth of the sea at this point \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 dx+p[tmod2k]dx+p[tmod2k] \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 can't exceed ll. In other words, dx+p[tmod2k]\xe2\x89\xa4ldx+p[tmod2k]\xe2\x89\xa4l must hold always.  Once Koa reaches the island at n+1n+1 meters from the shore, she stops and can rest.Note that while Koa swims tide doesn't have effect on her (ie. she can't drown while swimming). Note that Koa can choose to stay on the shore for as long as she needs and neither the shore or the island are affected by the tide (they are solid ground and she won't drown there). "
b'Koa wants to know whether she can go from the shore to the island. Help her!'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'

b'For each test case:'
b'Print Yes if Koa can get from the shore to the island, and No otherwise.'
b'You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
