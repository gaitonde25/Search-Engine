b"You're given an undirected graph with nn nodes and mm edges. Nodes are numbered from 11 to nn."
b'The graph is considered harmonious if and only if the following property holds:'
b'  For every triple of integers (l,m,r)(l,m,r) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4l<m<r\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l<m<r\xe2\x89\xa4n, if there exists a path going from node ll to node rr, then there exists a path going from node ll to node mm. '
b'In other words, in a harmonious graph, if from a node ll we can reach a node rr through edges (l<rl<r), then we should able to reach nodes (l+1),(l+2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(r\xe2\x88\x921)(l+1),(l+2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(r\xe2\x88\x921) too.'
b'What is the minimum number of edges we need to add to make the graph harmonious? '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200\xc2\xa00003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200\xc2\xa0000 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4200\xc2\xa00001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4200\xc2\xa0000).'
b"The ii-th of the next mm lines contains two integers uiui and vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi), that mean that there's an edge between nodes uu and vv."
b'It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes).'
b'Output'
b'Print the minimum number of edges we have to add to the graph to make it harmonious.'
