b'These days Arkady works as an air traffic controller at a large airport. He controls a runway which is usually used for landings only. Thus, he has a schedule of planes that are landing in the nearest future, each landing lasts 11 minute.'
b'He was asked to insert one takeoff in the schedule. The takeoff takes 11 minute itself, but for safety reasons there should be a time space between the takeoff and any landing of at least ss minutes from both sides.'
b'Find the earliest time when Arkady can insert the takeoff.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains two integers nn and ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 1\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4601\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa460)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of landings on the schedule and the minimum allowed time (in minutes) between a landing and a takeoff.'
b'Each of next nn lines contains two integers hh and mm (0\xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x89\xa423, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4590\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa459)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the time, in hours and minutes, when a plane will land, starting from current moment (i.\xc2\xa0e. the current time is 00 00). These times are given in increasing order.'
b'Output'
b'Print two integers hh and mm\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the hour and the minute from the current moment of the earliest time Arkady can insert the takeoff.'
