b'Phoenix is playing with a new puzzle, which consists of nn identical puzzle pieces. Each puzzle piece is a right isosceles triangle as shown below.'
b'  A puzzle piece '
b"The goal of the puzzle is to create a square using the nn pieces. He is allowed to rotate and move the pieces around, but none of them can overlap and all nn pieces must be used (of course, the square shouldn't contain any holes as well). Can he do it?"
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of puzzle pieces.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, if Phoenix can create a square with the nn puzzle pieces, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.'
