b'Recently, Polycarp has invented a new mobile game with falling blocks.'
b"In the game, nn blocks are falling down, one at a time, towards a flat surface with length dd units. Each block can be represented as a rectangle with coordinates from lili to riri and unit height, dropped downwards from very high up. A block falls until it comes in contact with the flat surface or any other block. Let's define that block aa covers block bb if la\xe2\x89\xa4lb\xe2\x89\xa4rb\xe2\x89\xa4rala\xe2\x89\xa4lb\xe2\x89\xa4rb\xe2\x89\xa4ra. "
b'Consider what happens when a new block ii falls. If the new (upper) block ii comes in contact with any block jj such that block ii does not cover block jj, block ii will stick to block jj, and no blocks will disappear. Otherwise, all blocks that block ii covers and is in contact with will be vaporized, and block ii will continue falling with the ability to vaporize lower blocks.'
b'For example, consider what happens when three blocks (1,2)(1,2), (2,3)(2,3) and (1,3)(1,3) fall, in that order. The first block will stick to the flat surface. Then, the second block will stick to the first block. Finally, the third block will vaporize the second block, keep falling, vaporize the first block, and stick to the flat surface.'
b'  Here is a graphic for the first example. '
b'After each block falls, help Polycarp determine how many blocks will remain!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and dd (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,d\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,d\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of falling blocks and the length of the flat surface.'
b'The ii-th of the following nn lines contains integers lili and riri (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4d1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4d) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the ii-th block. '
b'Output'
b'Output nn integers. The ii-th integer should be the number of blocks that will be left after the ii-th block falls.'
