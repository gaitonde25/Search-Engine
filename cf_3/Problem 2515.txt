b'Gildong is playing a video game called Block Adventure. In Block Adventure, there are nn columns of blocks in a row, and the columns are numbered from 11 to nn. All blocks have equal heights. The height of the ii-th column is represented as hihi, which is the number of blocks stacked in the ii-th column.'
b'Gildong plays the game as a character that can stand only on the top of the columns. At the beginning, the character is standing on the top of the 11-st column. The goal of the game is to move the character to the top of the nn-th column.'
b'The character also has a bag that can hold infinitely many blocks. When the character is on the top of the ii-th column, Gildong can take one of the following three actions as many times as he wants: '
b'  if there is at least one block on the column, remove one block from the top of the ii-th column and put it in the bag;  if there is at least one block in the bag, take one block out of the bag and place it on the top of the ii-th column;  if i<ni<n and |hi\xe2\x88\x92hi+1|\xe2\x89\xa4k|hi\xe2\x88\x92hi+1|\xe2\x89\xa4k, move the character to the top of the i+1i+1-st column. kk is a non-negative integer given at the beginning of the game. Note that it is only possible to move to the next column. '
b'In actions of the first two types the character remains in the ii-th column, and the value hihi changes.'
b'The character initially has mm blocks in the bag. Gildong wants to know if it is possible to win the game. Help Gildong find the answer to his question.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000). Description of the test cases follows.'
b"The first line of each test case contains three integers nn, mm, and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4106, 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of columns in the game, the number of blocks in the character's bag at the beginning, and the non-negative integer kk described in the statement."
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers. The ii-th integer is hihi (0\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4106), the initial height of the ii-th column.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to win the game. Otherwise, print "NO".'
b'You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
