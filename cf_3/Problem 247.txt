b'Andrew has nn piles with stones. The ii-th pile contains aiai stones. He wants to make his table clean so he decided to put every stone either to the 11-st or the nn-th pile.'
b'Andrew can perform the following operation any number of times: choose 33 indices 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j<k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j<k\xe2\x89\xa4n, such that the jj-th pile contains at least 22 stones, then he takes 22 stones from the pile jj and puts one stone into pile ii and one stone into pile kk. '
b"Tell Andrew what is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the stones to piles 11 and nn, or determine if it's impossible."
b'Input'
b'The input contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line for each test case contains one integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the array.'
b'The second line contains a sequence of integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the array elements.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of the values nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case print the minimum number of operations needed to move stones to piles 11 and nn, or print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it's impossible."
