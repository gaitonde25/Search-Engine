b"Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to 11 meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively)."
b'It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is 55 seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes 11 second.'
b"Find the skier's time to roll all the path."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.'
b"Each set is given by one nonempty string of the characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E'. The length of the string does not exceed 105105 characters."
b'The sum of the lengths of tt given lines over all test cases in the input does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the desired path time in seconds.'
