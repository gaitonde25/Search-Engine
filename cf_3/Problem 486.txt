b'Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.'
b'A level is a rectangular grid of 22 rows and nn columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1,1)(1,1)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 at the intersection of the 11-st row and the 11-st column.'
b"Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x1,y1)(x1,y1) to cell (x2,y2)(x2,y2) in one step if |x1\xe2\x88\x92x2|\xe2\x89\xa41|x1\xe2\x88\x92x2|\xe2\x89\xa41 and |y1\xe2\x88\x92y2|\xe2\x89\xa41|y1\xe2\x88\x92y2|\xe2\x89\xa41. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid."
b"There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends."
b"To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2,n)(2,n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 at the intersection of row 22 and column nn."
b'Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of columns.'
b"The next two lines describe the level. The ii-th of these lines describes the ii-th line of the level\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell."
b'Additional constraint on the input: cells (1,1)(1,1) and (2,n)(2,n) are safe.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.'
