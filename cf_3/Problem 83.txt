b'You are given a rectangular grid with nn rows and mm columns. nn and mm are divisible by 44. Some of the cells are already colored black or white. It is guaranteed that no two colored cells share a corner or an edge.'
b'Color the remaining cells in a way that both the black and the white cells becomes orthogonally connected or determine that it is impossible.'
b'Consider a graph, where the black cells are the nodes. Two nodes are adjacent if the corresponding cells share an edge. If the described graph is connected, the black cells are orthogonally connected. Same for white cells.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa440001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa44000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn, mm (8\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa45008\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4500, nn and mm are divisible by 44) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns.'
b"Each of the next nn lines contains mm characters. Each character is either 'B', 'W' or '.', representing black, white or empty cell respectively. Two colored (black or white) cell does not share a corner or an edge."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of n\xe2\x8b\x85mn\xe2\x8b\x85m over all test cases does not exceed 250000250000.'
b'Output'
b'For each testcase print "NO" if there is no solution, otherwise print "YES" and a grid with the same format. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any.'
