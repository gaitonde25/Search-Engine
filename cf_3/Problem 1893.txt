b'You are given two integers nn and kk. Your task is to find if nn can be represented as a sum of kk distinct positive odd (not divisible by 22) integers or not.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The next tt lines describe test cases. The only line of the test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa41071\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa4107).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer \xe2\x80\x94 "YES" (without quotes) if nn can be represented as a sum of kk distinct positive odd (not divisible by 22) integers and "NO" otherwise.'
