b'A rectangle with its opposite corners in (0,0)(0,0) and (w,h)(w,h) and sides parallel to the axes is drawn on a plane.'
b'You are given a list of lattice points such that each point lies on a side of a rectangle but not in its corner. Also, there are at least two points on every side of a rectangle.'
b'Your task is to choose three points in such a way that: '
b'  exactly two of them belong to the same side of a rectangle;  the area of a triangle formed by them is maximum possible. '
b'Print the doubled area of this triangle. It can be shown that the doubled area of any triangle formed by lattice points is always an integer.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'The first line of each testcase contains two integers ww and hh (3\xe2\x89\xa4w,h\xe2\x89\xa41063\xe2\x89\xa4w,h\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the corner of a rectangle.'
b'The next two lines contain the description of the points on two horizontal sides. First, an integer kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points. Then, kk integers x1<x2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<xkx1<x2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<xk (0<xi<w0<xi<w)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the xx coordinates of the points in the ascending order. The yy coordinate for the first line is 00 and for the second line is hh.'
b'The next two lines contain the description of the points on two vertical sides. First, an integer kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points. Then, kk integers y1<y2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<yky1<y2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<yk (0<yi<h0<yi<h)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the yy coordinates of the points in the ascending order. The xx coordinate for the first line is 00 and for the second line is ww.'
b"The total number of points on all sides in all testcases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the doubled maximum area of a triangle formed by such three points that exactly two of them belong to the same side.'
