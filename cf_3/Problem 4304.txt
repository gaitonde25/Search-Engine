b'As you might remember from the previous round, Vova is currently playing a strategic game known as Rage of Empires.'
b'Vova managed to build a large army, but forgot about the main person in the army - the commander. So he tries to hire a commander, and he wants to choose the person who will be respected by warriors.'
b'Each warrior is represented by his personality \xe2\x80\x94 an integer number pi. Each commander has two characteristics \xe2\x80\x94 his personality pj and leadership lj (both are integer numbers). Warrior i respects commander j only if  ( is the bitwise excluding OR of x and y).'
b"Initially Vova's army is empty. There are three different types of events that can happen with the army:"
b"  1\xc2\xa0pi \xe2\x80\x94 one warrior with personality pi joins Vova's army;  2\xc2\xa0pi \xe2\x80\x94 one warrior with personality pi leaves Vova's army;  3\xc2\xa0pi\xc2\xa0li \xe2\x80\x94 Vova tries to hire a commander with personality pi and leadership li. "
b"For each event of the third type Vova wants to know how many warriors (counting only those who joined the army and haven't left yet) respect the commander he tries to hire."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer q (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89q\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of events.'
b'Then q lines follow. Each line describes the event:'
b"  1\xc2\xa0pi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89108) \xe2\x80\x94 one warrior with personality pi joins Vova's army;  2\xc2\xa0pi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89108) \xe2\x80\x94 one warrior with personality pi leaves Vova's army (it is guaranteed that there is at least one such warrior in Vova's army by this moment);  3\xc2\xa0pi\xc2\xa0li (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi,\xe2\x80\x89li\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89108) \xe2\x80\x94 Vova tries to hire a commander with personality pi and leadership li. There is at least one event of this type. "
b'Output'
b'For each event of the third type print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of warriors who respect the commander Vova tries to hire in the event.'
