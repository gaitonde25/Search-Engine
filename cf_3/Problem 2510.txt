b'Input'
b'The first line contains integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of students in the class and the number of questions in the test.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains string sisi (|si|=m|si|=m), describing an answer of the ii-th student. The jj-th character represents the student answer (A, B, C, D or E) on the jj-th question.'
b'The last line contains mm integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ama1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,am (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points for the correct answer for every question.'
