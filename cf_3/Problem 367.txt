b'You are given two strings ss and tt of equal length nn. In one move, you can swap any two adjacent characters of the string ss.'
b'You need to find the minimal number of operations you need to make string ss lexicographically smaller than string tt.'
b'A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds: '
b'  aa is a prefix of bb, but a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb. '
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa410000): the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The second line of each test case contains the string ss consisting of nn lowercase English letters.'
b'The third line of each test case contains the string tt consisting of nn lowercase English letters.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, print in a separate line the minimal number of operations you need to make string ss lexicographically smaller than string tt, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921, if it's impossible."
