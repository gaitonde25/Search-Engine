b'Vasya has got a tree consisting of nn vertices. He wants to delete some (possibly zero) edges in this tree such that the maximum matching in the resulting graph is unique. He asks you to calculate the number of ways to choose a set of edges to remove.'
b'A matching in the graph is a subset of its edges such that there is no vertex incident to two (or more) edges from the subset. A maximum matching is a matching such that the number of edges in the subset is maximum possible among all matchings in this graph.'
b'Since the answer may be large, output it modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n,u\xe2\x89\xa0v1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n,u\xe2\x89\xa0v) denoting an edge between vertex uu and vertex vv. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to delete some (possibly empty) subset of edges so that the maximum matching in the resulting graph is unique. Print the answer modulo 998244353998244353.'
