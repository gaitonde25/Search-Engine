b"Julia's nn friends want to organize a startup in a new country they moved to. They assigned each other numbers from 1 to nn according to the jobs they have, from the most front-end tasks to the most back-end ones. They also estimated a matrix cc, where cij=cjicij=cji is the average number of messages per month between people doing jobs ii and jj."
b'Now they want to make a hierarchy tree. It will be a binary tree with each node containing one member of the team. Some member will be selected as a leader of the team and will be contained in the root node. In order for the leader to be able to easily reach any subordinate, for each node vv of the tree, the following should apply: all members in its left subtree must have smaller numbers than vv, and all members in its right subtree must have larger numbers than vv.'
b"After the hierarchy tree is settled, people doing jobs ii and jj will be communicating via the shortest path in the tree between their nodes. Let's denote the length of this path as dijdij. Thus, the cost of their communication is cij\xe2\x8b\x85dijcij\xe2\x8b\x85dij."
b'Your task is to find a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication over all pairs: \xe2\x88\x911\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4ncij\xe2\x8b\x85dij\xe2\x88\x911\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4ncij\xe2\x8b\x85dij.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 the number of team members organizing a startup.'
b'The next nn lines contain nn integers each, jj-th number in ii-th line is cijcij\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the estimated number of messages per month between team members ii and jj (0\xe2\x89\xa4cij\xe2\x89\xa4109;cij=cji;cii=00\xe2\x89\xa4cij\xe2\x89\xa4109;cij=cji;cii=0).'
b'Output'
b'Output a description of a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication. To do so, for each team member from 1 to nn output the number of the member in its parent node, or 0 for the leader. If there are many optimal trees, output a description of any one of them.'
