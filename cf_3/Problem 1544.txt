b'After returning to shore, uncle Bogdan usually visits the computer club "The Rock", to solve tasks in a pleasant company. One day, uncle Bogdan met his good old friend who told him one unusual task...'
b"There are nn non-intersecting horizontal segments with ends in integers points on the plane with the standard cartesian coordinate system. All segments are strictly above the OXOX axis. You can choose an arbitrary vector (aa, bb), where b<0b<0 and coordinates are real numbers, and project all segments to OXOX axis along this vector. The projections shouldn't intersect but may touch each other."
b'Find the minimum possible difference between xx coordinate of the right end of the rightmost projection and xx coordinate of the left end of the leftmost projection.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of segments.'
b'The ii-th of the next nn lines contains three integers xlixli, xrixri and yiyi (\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xli<xri\xe2\x89\xa4106\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xli<xri\xe2\x89\xa4106; 1\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of the corresponding segment.'
b"It's guaranteed that the segments don't intersect or touch."
b'Output'
b'Print the minimum possible difference you can get.'
b"Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926."
b"Formally, if your answer is aa and jury's answer is bb then your answer will be considered correct if |a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,|b|)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926|a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,|b|)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926."
