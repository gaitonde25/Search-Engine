b'For the each exam ii there are known two days: aiai \xe2\x80\x94 day of the first opportunity to pass the exam, bibi \xe2\x80\x94 day of the second opportunity to pass the exam (ai<biai<bi). Polycarp can pass at most one exam during each day. For each exam Polycarp chooses by himself which day he will pass this exam. He has to pass all the nn exams.'

b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of exams.'
b'The next nn lines contain two integers each: aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai<bi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai<bi\xe2\x89\xa4109), where aiai is the number of day of the first passing the ii-th exam and bibi is the number of day of the second passing the ii-th exam.'
