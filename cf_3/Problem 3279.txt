b'In the last mission, MDCS has successfully shipped NN AI robots to Mars. Before they start exploring, system initialization is required so they are arranged in a line. Every robot can be described with three numbers: position (xixi), radius of sight (riri) and IQ (qiqi).'
b"Since they are intelligent robots, some of them will talk if they see each other. Radius of sight is inclusive, so robot can see other all robots in range [xi\xe2\x88\x92ri,xi+ri][xi\xe2\x88\x92ri,xi+ri]. But they don't walk to talk with anybody, but only with robots who have similar IQ. By similar IQ we mean that their absolute difference isn't more than KK. "
b' Help us and calculate how many pairs of robots are going to talk with each other, so we can timely update their software and avoid any potential quarrel.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers, numbers N(1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105)N(1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105) and K(0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa420)K(0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa420).'
b'Next NN lines contain three numbers each xi,ri,qi(0\xe2\x89\xa4xi,ri,qi\xe2\x89\xa4109)xi,ri,qi(0\xe2\x89\xa4xi,ri,qi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 position, radius of sight and IQ of every robot respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Output contains only one number \xe2\x80\x94 solution to the problem.'
