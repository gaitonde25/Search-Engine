b'You are given a string ss. Each character is either 0 or 1.'
b"You want all 1's in the string to form a contiguous subsegment. For example, if the string is 0, 1, 00111 or 01111100, then all 1's form a contiguous subsegment, and if the string is 0101, 100001 or 11111111111101, then this condition is not met."
b"You may erase some (possibly none) 0's from the string. What is the minimum number of 0's that you have to erase?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Then tt lines follow, each representing a test case. Each line contains one string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4100); each character of ss is either 0 or 1.'
b'Output'
b"Print tt integers, where the ii-th integer is the answer to the ii-th testcase (the minimum number of 0's that you have to erase from ss)."
