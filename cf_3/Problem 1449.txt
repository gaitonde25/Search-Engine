b'There is a road with length ll meters. The start of the road has coordinate 00, the end of the road has coordinate ll.'
b'There are two cars, the first standing at the start of the road and the second standing at the end of the road. They will start driving simultaneously. The first car will drive from the start to the end and the second car will drive from the end to the start.'
b'Initially, they will drive with a speed of 11 meter per second. There are nn flags at different coordinates a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. Each time when any of two cars drives through a flag, the speed of that car increases by 11 meter per second.'
b'Find how long will it take for cars to meet (to reach the same coordinate). '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104): the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn, ll (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4109): the number of flags and the length of the road.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an in the increasing order (1\xe2\x89\xa4a1<a2<\xe2\x80\xa6<an<l1\xe2\x89\xa4a1<a2<\xe2\x80\xa6<an<l).'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn among all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a single real number: the time required for cars to meet.'
b"Your answer will be considered correct, if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926. More formally, if your answer is aa and jury's answer is bb, your answer will be considered correct if |a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,b)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926|a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,b)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926."
