b'Vanya got bored and he painted n distinct points on the plane. After that he connected all the points pairwise and saw that as a result many triangles were formed with vertices in the painted points. He asks you to count the number of the formed triangles with the non-zero area.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the points painted on the plane. '
b'Next n lines contain two integers each xi,\xe2\x80\x89yi (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89xi,\xe2\x80\x89yi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100) \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that no two given points coincide.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print an integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of triangles with the non-zero area among the painted points.'
