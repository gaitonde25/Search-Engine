b'One player came to a casino and found a slot machine where everything depends only on how he plays. The rules follow.'
b'A positive integer aa is initially on the screen. The player can put a coin into the machine and then add 11 to or subtract 11 from any two adjacent digits. All digits must remain from 00 to 99 after this operation, and the leading digit must not equal zero. In other words, it is forbidden to add 11 to 99, to subtract 11 from 00 and to subtract 11 from the leading 11. Once the number on the screen becomes equal to bb, the player wins the jackpot. aa and bb have the same number of digits.'
b'Help the player to determine the minimal number of coins he needs to spend in order to win the jackpot and tell how to play.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) standing for the length of numbers aa and bb.'
b'The next two lines contain numbers aa and bb, each one on a separate line (10n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4a,b<10n10n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4a,b<10n).'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to win the jackpot, print a single integer \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Otherwise, the first line must contain the minimal possible number cc of coins the player has to spend.'
b'min(c,105)min(c,105) lines should follow, ii-th of them containing two integers didi and sisi (1\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921, si=\xc2\xb11si=\xc2\xb11) denoting that on the ii-th step the player should add sisi to the didi-th and (di+1)(di+1)-st digits from the left (e. g. di=1di=1 means that two leading digits change while di=n\xe2\x88\x921di=n\xe2\x88\x921 means that there are two trailing digits which change).'
b'Please notice that the answer may be very big and in case c>105c>105 you should print only the first 105105 moves. Your answer is considered correct if it is possible to finish your printed moves to win the jackpot in the minimal possible number of coins. In particular, if there are multiple ways to do this, you can output any of them.'
