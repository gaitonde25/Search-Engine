b'Nikita likes tasks on order statistics, for example, he can easily find the kk-th number in increasing order on a segment of an array. But now Nikita wonders how many segments of an array there are such that a given number xx is the kk-th number in increasing order on this segment. In other words, you should find the number of segments of a given array such that there are exactly kk numbers of this segment which are less than xx.'
b'Nikita wants to get answer for this question for each kk from 00 to nn, where nn is the size of the array.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)(\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the given array.'
b'Output'
b"Print n+1n+1 integers, where the ii-th number is the answer for Nikita's question for k=i\xe2\x88\x921k=i\xe2\x88\x921."
