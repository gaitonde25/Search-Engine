b'Phoenix is trying to take a photo of his nn friends with labels 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n who are lined up in a row in a special order. But before he can take the photo, his friends get distracted by a duck and mess up their order.'
b"Now, Phoenix must restore the order but he doesn't remember completely! He only remembers that the ii-th friend from the left had a label between aiai and bibi inclusive. Does there exist a unique way to order his friends based of his memory? "
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of friends.'
b"The ii-th of the next nn lines contain two integers aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Phoenix's memory of the ii-th position from the left."
b"It is guaranteed that Phoenix's memory is valid so there is at least one valid ordering."
b'Output'
b'If Phoenix can reorder his friends in a unique order, print YES followed by nn integers \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the ii-th integer should be the label of the ii-th friend from the left.'
b'Otherwise, print NO. Then, print any two distinct valid orderings on the following two lines. If are multiple solutions, print any.'
