b'You are given a matrix aa consisting of positive integers. It has nn rows and mm columns.'
b'Construct a matrix bb consisting of positive integers. It should have the same size as aa, and the following conditions should be met: '
b'  1\xe2\x89\xa4bi,j\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4bi,j\xe2\x89\xa4106;  bi,jbi,j is a multiple of ai,jai,j;  the absolute value of the difference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells (two cells that share the same side) in bb is equal to k4k4 for some integer k\xe2\x89\xa51k\xe2\x89\xa51 (kk is not necessarily the same for all pairs, it is own for each pair). '
b'We can show that the answer always exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (2\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa45002\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4500).'
b'Each of the following nn lines contains mm integers. The jj-th integer in the ii-th line is ai,jai,j (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4161\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa416).'
b'Output'
b'The output should contain nn lines each containing mm integers. The jj-th integer in the ii-th line should be bi,jbi,j.'
