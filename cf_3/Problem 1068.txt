b"You have nn stacks of blocks. The ii-th stack contains hihi blocks and it's height is the number of blocks in it. In one move you can take a block from the ii-th stack (if there is at least one block) and put it to the i+1i+1-th stack. Can you make the sequence of heights strictly increasing?"
b"Note that the number of stacks always remains nn: stacks don't disappear when they have 00 blocks."
b'Input'
b'First line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100). The second line of each test case contains nn integers hihi (0\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109)(0\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 starting heights of the stacks.'
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of all nn does not exceed 104104."
b'Output'
b'For each test case output YES if you can make the sequence of heights strictly increasing and NO otherwise.'
b'You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).'
