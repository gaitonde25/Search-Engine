b'Today, Wet Shark is given n integers. Using any of these integers no more than once, Wet Shark wants to get maximum possible even (divisible by 2) sum. Please, calculate this value for Wet Shark. '
b'Note, that if Wet Shark uses no integers from the n integers, the sum is an even integer 0.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer, n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000). The next line contains n space separated integers given to Wet Shark. Each of these integers is in range from 1 to 109, inclusive. '
b'Output'
b'Print the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained if we use some of the given integers. '
