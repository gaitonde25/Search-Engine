b"Two players, Red and Blue, are at it again, and this time they're playing with crayons! The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game."
b'The game works as follows: there is a tree of size nn, rooted at node 11, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first. '
b"In Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times: "
b'  Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. '
b' However, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color '
b''
b'kk'
b'k'
b" nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most "
b''
b'kk'
b'k'
b' of the nodes can be colored red.'
b"Then, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times: "
b"  Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. "
b" Note: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored."
b'After the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let ww be the number of white nodes, rr be the number of red nodes, and bb be the number of blue nodes. The score of the game is w\xe2\x8b\x85(r\xe2\x88\x92b)w\xe2\x8b\x85(r\xe2\x88\x92b).'
b'Red wants to maximize this score, and Blue wants to minimize it. If both players play optimally, what will the final score of the game be?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum number of red nodes.'
b'Next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains description of edges. The ii-th line contains two space separated integers uiui and vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n; ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the ii-th edge of the tree.'
b"It's guaranteed that given edges form a tree."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the resulting score if both Red and Blue play optimally.'
