b' Gathering darkness shrouds the woods and the world. The moon sheds its light on the boat and the river."To curtain off the moonlight should be hardly possible; the shades present its mellow beauty and restful nature." Intonates Mino."See? The clouds are coming." Kanno gazes into the distance."That can\'t be better," Mino turns to Kanno. '
b'The sky can be seen as a one-dimensional axis. The moon is at the origin whose coordinate is 00.'
b'There are nn clouds floating in the sky. Each cloud has the same length ll. The ii-th initially covers the range of (xi,xi+l)(xi,xi+l) (endpoints excluded). Initially, it moves at a velocity of vivi, which equals either 11 or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Furthermore, no pair of clouds intersect initially, that is, for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n, |xi\xe2\x88\x92xj|\xe2\x89\xa5l|xi\xe2\x88\x92xj|\xe2\x89\xa5l.'
b'With a wind velocity of ww, the velocity of the ii-th cloud becomes vi+wvi+w. That is, its coordinate increases by vi+wvi+w during each unit of time. Note that the wind can be strong and clouds can change their direction.'
b"You are to help Mino count the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) (i<ji<j), such that with a proper choice of wind velocity ww not exceeding wmaxwmax in absolute value (possibly negative and/or fractional), the ii-th and jj-th clouds both cover the moon at the same future moment. This ww doesn't need to be the same across different pairs."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three space-separated integers nn, ll, and wmaxwmax (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4l,wmax\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4l,wmax\xe2\x89\xa4108)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of clouds, the length of each cloud and the maximum wind speed, respectively.'
b'The ii-th of the following nn lines contains two space-separated integers xixi and vivi (\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4108\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4108, vi\xe2\x88\x88{\xe2\x88\x921,1}vi\xe2\x88\x88{\xe2\x88\x921,1})\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial position and the velocity of the ii-th cloud, respectively.'
b'The input guarantees that for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n, |xi\xe2\x88\x92xj|\xe2\x89\xa5l|xi\xe2\x88\x92xj|\xe2\x89\xa5l.'
b'Output'
b"Output one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of unordered pairs of clouds such that it's possible that clouds from each pair cover the moon at the same future moment with a proper choice of wind velocity ww."
