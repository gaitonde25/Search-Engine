b"The marmots have prepared a very easy problem for this year's HC2 \xe2\x80\x93 this one. It involves numbers n, k and a sequence of n positive integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an. They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal."
b'However I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892200). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89104).'
b'Output'
b'Output one number.'
