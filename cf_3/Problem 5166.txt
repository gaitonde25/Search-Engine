b'A group of n cities is connected by a network of roads. There is an undirected road between every pair of cities, so there are  roads in total. It takes exactly y seconds to traverse any single road.'
b"A spanning tree is a set of roads containing exactly n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 roads such that it's possible to travel between any two cities using only these roads."
b"Some spanning tree of the initial network was chosen. For every road in this tree the time one needs to traverse this road was changed from y to x seconds. Note that it's not guaranteed that x is smaller than y."
b'You would like to travel through all the cities using the shortest path possible. Given n, x, y and a description of the spanning tree that was chosen, find the cost of the shortest path that starts in any city, ends in any city and visits all cities exactly once.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains three integers n, x and y (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89200\xe2\x80\x89000,\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89x,\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109).'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines contains a description of a road in the spanning tree. The i-th of these lines contains two integers ui and vi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ui,\xe2\x80\x89vi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 indices of the cities connected by the i-th road. It is guaranteed that these roads form a spanning tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of seconds one needs to spend in order to visit all the cities exactly once.'
