b'You are given an undirected tree consisting of nn vertices. An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 edges.'
b'Your task is to add the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest path from the vertex 11 to any other vertex is at most 22. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b'The following n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain edges: edge ii is given as a pair of vertices ui,viui,vi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of edges you have to add in order to make the shortest distance from the vertex 11 to any other vertex at most 22. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.'
