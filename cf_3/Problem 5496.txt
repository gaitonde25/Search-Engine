b'Tavas is a cheerleader in the new sports competition named "Pashmaks".'
b'  '
b'This competition consists of two part: swimming and then running. People will immediately start running R meters after they finished swimming exactly S meters. A winner is a such person that nobody else finishes running before him/her (there may be more than one winner).'
b"Before the match starts, Tavas knows that there are n competitors registered for the match. Also, he knows that i-th person's swimming speed is si meters per second and his/her running speed is ri meters per second. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the values of R and S, but he knows that they are real numbers greater than 0."
b'As a cheerleader, Tavas wants to know who to cheer up. So, he wants to know all people that might win. We consider a competitor might win if and only if there are some values of R and S such that with these values, (s)he will be a winner.'
b"Tavas isn't really familiar with programming, so he asked you to help him."
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89105).'
b'The next n lines contain the details of competitors. i-th line contains two integers si and ri (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89si,\xe2\x80\x89ri\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89104).'
