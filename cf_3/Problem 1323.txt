b'Polycarp has just finished writing down the lecture on elvish languages. The language this week was "VwV" (pronounced as "uwu"). The writing system of this language consists of only two lowercase Latin letters: \'v\' and \'w\'.'
b"Unfortunately, Polycarp has written all the lecture in cursive and without any spaces, so the notes look like a neverending sequence of squiggles. To be exact, Polycarp can't tell 'w' apart from 'vv' in his notes as both of them consist of the same two squiggles."
b"Luckily, his brother Monocarp has better writing habits, so Polycarp managed to take his notes and now wants to make his own notes more readable. To do that he can follow the notes of Monocarp and underline some letters in his own notes in such a way that there is no more ambiguity. If he underlines a 'v', then it can't be mistaken for a part of some 'w', and if the underlines a 'w', then it can't be mistaken for two adjacent letters 'v'."
b'What is the minimum number of letters Polycarp should underline to make his notes unambiguous?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b"Each of the next tt lines contains a non-empty string in VwV language, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters 'v' and 'w'. The length of the string does not exceed 100100."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase print a single integer: the minimum number of letters Polycarp should underline so that there is no ambiguity in his notes.'
