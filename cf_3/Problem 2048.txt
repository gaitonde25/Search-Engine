b'This is an interactive problem!'
b'On a normal day at the hidden office in A.R.C. Markland-N, Rin received an artifact, given to her by the exploration captain Sagar.'
b'After much analysis, she now realizes that this artifact contains data about a strange flower, which has existed way before the New Age. However, the information about its chemical structure has been encrypted heavily.'
b'The chemical structure of this flower can be represented as a string pp. From the unencrypted papers included, Rin already knows the length nn of that string, and she can also conclude that the string contains at most three distinct letters: "C" (as in Carbon), "H" (as in Hydrogen), and "O" (as in Oxygen).'
b"At each moment, Rin can input a string ss of an arbitrary length into the artifact's terminal, and it will return every starting position of ss as a substring of pp."
b"However, the artifact has limited energy and cannot be recharged in any way, since the technology is way too ancient and is incompatible with any current A.R.C.'s devices. To be specific:"
b'  The artifact only contains 7575 units of energy.  For each time Rin inputs a string ss of length tt, the artifact consumes 1t21t2 units of energy.  If the amount of energy reaches below zero, the task will be considered failed immediately, as the artifact will go black forever. '
b'Since the artifact is so precious yet fragile, Rin is very nervous to attempt to crack the final data. Can you give her a helping hand?'
