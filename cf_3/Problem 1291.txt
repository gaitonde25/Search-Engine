b'Artem is building a new robot. He has a matrix aa consisting of nn rows and mm columns. The cell located on the ii-th row from the top and the jj-th column from the left has a value ai,jai,j written in it. '
b'If two adjacent cells contain the same value, the robot will break. A matrix is called good if no two adjacent cells contain the same value, where two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. '
b'Artem wants to increment the values in some cells by one to make aa good.'
b'More formally, find a good matrix bb that satisfies the following condition\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 '
b'  For all valid (i,ji,j), either bi,j=ai,jbi,j=ai,j or bi,j=ai,j+1bi,j=ai,j+1. '
b'For the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that such a matrix bb always exists. If there are several such tables, you can output any of them. Please note that you do not have to minimize the number of increments.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers n,mn,m (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns, respectively.'
b'The following nn lines each contain mm integers. The jj-th integer in the ii-th line is ai,jai,j (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b'For each case, output nn lines each containing mm integers. The jj-th integer in the ii-th line is bi,jbi,j.'
