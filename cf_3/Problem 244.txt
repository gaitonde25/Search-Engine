b'You are given a tree with nn vertices numbered from 11 to nn. The height of the ii-th vertex is hihi. You can place any number of towers into vertices, for each tower you can choose which vertex to put it in, as well as choose its efficiency. Setting up a tower with efficiency ee costs ee coins, where e>0e>0.'
b'It is considered that a vertex xx gets a signal if for some pair of towers at the vertices uu and vv (u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v, but it is allowed that x=ux=u or x=vx=v) with efficiencies eueu and evev, respectively, it is satisfied that min(eu,ev)\xe2\x89\xa5hxmin(eu,ev)\xe2\x89\xa5hx and xx lies on the path between uu and vv.'
b'Find the minimum number of coins required to set up towers so that you can get a signal at all vertices.'
