b"Polycarp has three sisters: Alice, Barbara, and Cerene. They're collecting coins. Currently, Alice has aa coins, Barbara has bb coins and Cerene has cc coins. Recently Polycarp has returned from the trip around the world and brought nn coins."
b'He wants to distribute all these nn coins between his sisters in such a way that the number of coins Alice has is equal to the number of coins Barbara has and is equal to the number of coins Cerene has. In other words, if Polycarp gives AA coins to Alice, BB coins to Barbara and CC coins to Cerene (A+B+C=nA+B+C=n), then a+A=b+B=c+Ca+A=b+B=c+C.'
b'Note that A, B or C (the number of coins Polycarp gives to Alice, Barbara and Cerene correspondingly) can be 0.'
b'Your task is to find out if it is possible to distribute all nn coins between sisters in a way described above.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The next tt lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a new line and consists of four space-separated integers a,b,ca,b,c and nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c,n\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c,n\xe2\x89\xa4108) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of coins Alice has, the number of coins Barbara has, the number of coins Cerene has and the number of coins Polycarp has.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print "YES" if Polycarp can distribute all nn coins between his sisters and "NO" otherwise.'
