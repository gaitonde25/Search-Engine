b'This is an easy version of the problem. In this version, all numbers in the given array are distinct and the constraints on nn are less than in the hard version of the problem.'
b'You are given an array aa of nn integers (there are no equals elements in the array). You can perform the following operations on array elements:'
b'  choose any index ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) and move the element a[i]a[i] to the begin of the array;  choose any index ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) and move the element a[i]a[i] to the end of the array. '
b'For example, if n=5n=5, a=[4,7,2,3,9]a=[4,7,2,3,9], then the following sequence of operations can be performed: '
b'  after performing the operation of the first type to the second element, the array aa will become [7,4,2,3,9][7,4,2,3,9];  after performing the operation of the second type to the second element, the array aa will become [7,2,3,9,4][7,2,3,9,4]. '
b'You can perform operations of any type any number of times in any order.'
b'Find the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type that will make the aa array sorted in non-decreasing order. In other words, what is the minimum number of operations that must be performed so the array satisfies the inequalities a[1]\xe2\x89\xa4a[2]\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x89\xa4a[n]a[1]\xe2\x89\xa4a[2]\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x89\xa4a[n].'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the test. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case starts with a line containing an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa430001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 length of the array aa.'
b'Then follow nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 an array that needs to be sorted by the given operations. All numbers in the given array are distinct.'
b'The sum of nn for all test cases in one test does not exceed 30003000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum total number of operations of the first and second type, which will make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.'
