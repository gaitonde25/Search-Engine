b"The parking lot before the office consists of one line of (2n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892) parking spaces. Unfortunately the total number of cars is greater than the parking lot capacity. Furthermore even amount of cars of each make is greater than the amount of parking spaces! That's why there are no free spaces on the parking lot ever."

b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains one integer n (3\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8930) \xe2\x80\x94 the amount of successive cars of the same make.'
