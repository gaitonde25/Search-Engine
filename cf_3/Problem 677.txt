b'You are given a tree with nn nodes. As a reminder, a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.'
b'Let a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an be a sequence of integers. Perform the following operation exactly nn times: '
b'  Select an unerased node uu. Assign au:=au:= number of unerased nodes adjacent to uu. Then, erase the node uu along with all edges that have it as an endpoint. '
b'For each integer kk from 11 to nn, find the number, modulo 998244353998244353, of different sequences a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an that satisfy the following conditions:'
b'  it is possible to obtain aa by performing the aforementioned operations exactly nn times in some order.  gcd(a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an)=kgcd\xe2\x81\xa1(a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an)=k. Here, gcdgcd means the greatest common divisor of the elements in aa. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'

b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n) indicating there is an edge between vertices uu and vv. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print nn integers in a single line, where for each kk from 11 to nn, the kk-th integer denotes the answer when gcdgcd equals to kk.'
