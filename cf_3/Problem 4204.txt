b"You are given a tree with n vertices and you are allowed to perform no more than 2n transformations on it. Transformation is defined by three vertices x,\xe2\x80\x89y,\xe2\x80\x89y' and consists of deleting edge (x,\xe2\x80\x89y) and adding edge (x,\xe2\x80\x89y'). Transformation x,\xe2\x80\x89y,\xe2\x80\x89y' could be performed if all the following conditions are satisfied:"
b"  There is an edge (x,\xe2\x80\x89y) in the current tree.  After the transformation the graph remains a tree.  After the deletion of edge (x,\xe2\x80\x89y) the tree would consist of two connected components. Let's denote the set of nodes in the component containing vertex x by Vx, and the set of nodes in the component containing vertex y by Vy. Then condition |Vx|\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89|Vy| should be satisfied, i.e. the size of the component with x should be strictly larger than the size of the component with y. "
b'You should minimize the sum of squared distances between all pairs of vertices in a tree, which you could get after no more than 2n transformations and output any sequence of transformations leading initial tree to such state.'
b"Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations. It is necessary to minimize only the sum of the squared distances."
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105) \xe2\x80\x94 number of vertices in tree.'
b'The next n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines of input contains integers a and b (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89a\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89b) \xe2\x80\x94 the descriptions of edges. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line output integer k (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892n) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of transformations from your example, minimizing sum of squared distances between all pairs of vertices.'
b"In each of the next k lines output three integers x,\xe2\x80\x89y,\xe2\x80\x89y' \xe2\x80\x94 indices of vertices from the corresponding transformation."
b"Transformations with y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89y' are allowed (even though they don't change tree) if transformation conditions are satisfied."
b'If there are several possible answers, print any of them.'
