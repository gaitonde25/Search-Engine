b'Dreamoon likes strings. Today he created a game about strings:'
b'String s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn is beautiful if and only if for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n,si\xe2\x89\xa0si+11\xe2\x89\xa4i<n,si\xe2\x89\xa0si+1.'
b'Initially, Dreamoon has a string aa. In each step Dreamoon can choose a beautiful substring of aa and remove it. Then he should concatenate the remaining characters (in the same order).'
b'Dreamoon wants to use the smallest number of steps to make aa empty. Please help Dreamoon, and print any sequence of the smallest number of steps to make aa empty.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4200000), denoting the number of test cases in the input.'
b"For each test case, there's one line with a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters aa."
b'The total sum of lengths of strings in all test cases is at most 200000200000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, in the first line, you should print mm: the smallest number of steps to make aa empty. Each of the following mm lines should contain two integers li,rili,ri (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4|a|1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4|a|), denoting, that the ii-th step is removing the characters from index lili to riri in the current string. (indices are numbered starting from 11). '
b'Note that after the deletion of the substring, indices of remaining characters may change, and riri should be at most the current length of aa.'
b'If there are several possible solutions, you can print any.'
