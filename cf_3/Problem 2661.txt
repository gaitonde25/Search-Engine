b'This is an interactive problem.'
b"You're given a tree consisting of nn nodes, rooted at node 11. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles."
b'We chose a hidden node xx. In order to find this node, you can ask queries of two types: '
b'  d uu (1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4n). We will answer with the distance between nodes uu and xx. The distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the shortest path between them.  s uu (1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4n). We will answer with the second node on the path from uu to xx. However, there\'s a plot twist. If uu is not an ancestor of xx, you\'ll receive "Wrong answer" verdict! '
b'Node aa is called an ancestor of node bb if a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b and the shortest path from node 11 to node bb passes through node aa. Note that in this problem a node is not an ancestor of itself.'
b'Can you find xx in no more than 3636 queries? The hidden node is fixed in each test beforehand and does not depend on your queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of nodes in the tree.'
b"Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n) that mean there's an edge between nodes uu and vv. It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree."
b'Output'
b'To print the answer, print "! x" (without quotes).'
