b'Consider a tree TT (that is, a connected graph without cycles) with nn vertices labelled 11 through nn. We start the following process with TT: while TT has more than one vertex, do the following:'
b' choose a random edge of TT equiprobably; shrink the chosen edge: if the edge was connecting vertices vv and uu, erase both vv and uu and create a new vertex adjacent to all vertices previously adjacent to either vv or uu. The new vertex is labelled either vv or uu equiprobably.'
b'At the end of the process, TT consists of a single vertex labelled with one of the numbers 1,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,\xe2\x80\xa6,n. For each of the numbers, what is the probability of this number becoming the label of the final vertex?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450).'
b'The following n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describe the tree edges. Each of these lines contains two integers ui,viui,vi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 labels of vertices connected by the respective edge (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi). It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn floating numbers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the desired probabilities for labels 1,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,\xe2\x80\xa6,n respectively. All numbers should be correct up to 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926 relative or absolute precision.'
