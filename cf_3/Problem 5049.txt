b'Bear Limak has n colored balls, arranged in one long row. Balls are numbered 1 through n, from left to right. There are n possible colors, also numbered 1 through n. The i-th ball has color ti.'
b"For a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define a dominant color. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant."
b'There are  non-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x895000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of balls.'
b'The second line contains n integers t1,\xe2\x80\x89t2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89tn (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ti\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) where ti is the color of the i-th ball.'
b'Output'
b'Print n integers. The i-th of them should be equal to the number of intervals where i is a dominant color.'
