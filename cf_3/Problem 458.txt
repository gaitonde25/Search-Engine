b'YouKn0wWho has an integer sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. He will perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an index ii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|a|1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|a| and aiai is not divisible by (i+1)(i+1), and erase this element from the sequence. Here |a||a| is the length of sequence aa at the moment of operation. Note that the sequence aa changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.'
b'For example, if a=[3,5,4,5]a=[3,5,4,5], then he can select i=2i=2, because a2=5a2=5 is not divisible by i+1=3i+1=3. After this operation the sequence is [3,4,5][3,4,5].'
b'Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation, print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any register (upper or lower).'
