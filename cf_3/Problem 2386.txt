b'Mike and Ann are sitting in the classroom. The lesson is boring, so they decided to play an interesting game. Fortunately, all they need to play this game is a string ss and a number kk (0\xe2\x89\xa4k<|s|0\xe2\x89\xa4k<|s|).'
b'At the beginning of the game, players are given a substring of ss with left border ll and right border rr, both equal to kk (i.e. initially l=r=kl=r=k). Then players start to make moves one by one, according to the following rules:'
b" A player chooses l\xe2\x80\xb2l\xe2\x80\xb2 and r\xe2\x80\xb2r\xe2\x80\xb2 so that l\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4ll\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4l, r\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa5rr\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa5r and s[l\xe2\x80\xb2,r\xe2\x80\xb2]s[l\xe2\x80\xb2,r\xe2\x80\xb2] is lexicographically less than s[l,r]s[l,r]. Then the player changes ll and rr in this way: l:=l\xe2\x80\xb2l:=l\xe2\x80\xb2, r:=r\xe2\x80\xb2r:=r\xe2\x80\xb2. Ann moves first. The player, that can't make a move loses."
b'Recall that a substring s[l,r]s[l,r] (l\xe2\x89\xa4rl\xe2\x89\xa4r) of a string ss is a continuous segment of letters from s that starts at position ll and ends at position rr. For example, "ehn" is a substring (s[3,5]s[3,5]) of "aaaehnsvz" and "ahz" is not.'
b"Mike and Ann were playing so enthusiastically that they did not notice the teacher approached them. Surprisingly, the teacher didn't scold them, instead of that he said, that he can figure out the winner of the game before it starts, even if he knows only ss and kk."
b'Unfortunately, Mike and Ann are not so keen in the game theory, so they ask you to write a program, that takes ss and determines the winner for all possible kk.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105) consisting of lowercase English letters.'
b'Output'
b'Print |s||s| lines.'
b'In the line ii write the name of the winner (print Mike or Ann) in the game with string ss and k=ik=i, if both play optimally'
