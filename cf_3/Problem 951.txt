b'A bitstring is a string that contains only the characters 0 and 1.'
b'Koyomi Kanou is working hard towards her dream of becoming a writer. To practice, she decided to participate in the Binary Novel Writing Contest. The writing prompt for the contest consists of three bitstrings of length 2n2n. A valid novel for the contest is a bitstring of length at most 3n3n that contains at least two of the three given strings as subsequences.'
b'Koyomi has just received the three prompt strings from the contest organizers. Help her write a valid novel for the contest.'
b'A string aa is a subsequence of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'Each of the following three lines contains a bitstring of length 2n2n. It is guaranteed that these three strings are pairwise distinct.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn across all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single line containing a bitstring of length at most 3n3n that has at least two of the given bitstrings as subsequences.'
b'It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such a bitstring always exists.'
b'If there are multiple possible answers, you may output any of them.'
