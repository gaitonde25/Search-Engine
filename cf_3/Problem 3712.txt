b"Jenya has recently acquired quite a useful tool \xe2\x80\x94 k-scissors for cutting strings. They are generally used for cutting out two non-intersecting substrings of length k from an arbitrary string s (its length should be at least 2\xc2\xb7k in order to perform this operation) and concatenating them afterwards (preserving the initial order). For example, with the help of 2-scissors you can cut ab and de out of abcde and concatenate them into abde, but not ab and bc since they're intersecting."
b"It's a nice idea to test this tool before using it in practice. After looking through the papers, Jenya came up with two strings s and t. His question is whether it is possible to apply his scissors to string s such that the resulting concatenation contains t as a substring?"
b'Input'
b"The first line contains three integers n, m, k (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x895\xc2\xb7105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 length of s, length of t and the aforementioned scissors' parameter correspondingly."
b'The next two lines feature s and t consisting of lowercase latin letters.'
b'Output'
b'If there is no answer, print \xc2\xabNo\xc2\xbb. '
b'Otherwise print \xc2\xabYes\xc2\xbb and two integers L and R denoting the indexes where cutted substrings start (1-indexed). If there are several possible answers, output any.'
