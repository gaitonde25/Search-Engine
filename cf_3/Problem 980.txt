b'Kostya is extremely busy: he is renovating his house! He needs to hand wallpaper, assemble furniture throw away trash.'
b'Kostya is buying tiles for bathroom today. He is standing in front of a large square stand with tiles in a shop. The stand is a square of n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n cells, each cell of which contains a small tile with color ci,jci,j. The shop sells tiles in packs: more specifically, you can only buy a subsquare of the initial square.'
b'A subsquare is any square part of the stand, i.\xc2\xa0e. any set S(i0,j0,k)={ci,j\xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0i0\xe2\x89\xa4i<i0+k,j0\xe2\x89\xa4j<j0+k}S(i0,j0,k)={ci,j\xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0i0\xe2\x89\xa4i<i0+k,j0\xe2\x89\xa4j<j0+k} with 1\xe2\x89\xa4i0,j0\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92k+11\xe2\x89\xa4i0,j0\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92k+1.'
b"Kostya still does not know how many tiles he needs, so he considers the subsquares of all possible sizes. He doesn't want his bathroom to be too colorful. Help Kostya to count for each k\xe2\x89\xa4nk\xe2\x89\xa4n the number of subsquares of size k\xc3\x97kk\xc3\x97k that have at most qq different colors of tiles. Two subsquares are considered different if their location on the stand is different."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa415001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41500, 1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa410)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of the stand and the limit on the number of distinct colors in a subsquare.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains nn integers ci,jci,j (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci,j\xe2\x89\xa4n21\xe2\x89\xa4ci,j\xe2\x89\xa4n2): the jj-th integer in the ii-th line is the color of the tile in the cell (i,j)(i,j).'
b'Output'
b'For each kk from 11 to nn print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of subsquares of size k\xc3\x97kk\xc3\x97k with no more than qq different colors.'
