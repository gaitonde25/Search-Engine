b'You are given a tree with nn vertices. Each vertex ii has a value aiai associated with it.'
b'Let us root the tree at some vertex vv. The vertex vv is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at vv and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.'
b'Find the number of distinctive roots in the tree.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b'The next line contains nn space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The following n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines each contain two space-separated integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u1\xe2\x89\xa4u, v\xe2\x89\xa4nv\xe2\x89\xa4n), denoting an edge from uu to vv.'
b'It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of distinctive roots in the tree.'
