b'Given a connected undirected graph with nn vertices and an integer kk, you have to either:'
b'  either find an independent set that has exactly \xe2\x8c\x88k2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88k2\xe2\x8c\x89 vertices. or find a simple cycle of length at most kk. '
b"An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. "
b"I have a proof that for any input you can always solve at least one of these problems, but it's left as an exercise for the reader."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, mm, and kk (3\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the parameter kk from the statement.'
b"Each of the next mm lines contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n) that mean there's an edge between vertices uu and vv. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges."
b'Output'
b'If you choose to solve the first problem, then on the first line print 11, followed by a line containing \xe2\x8c\x88k2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88k2\xe2\x8c\x89 distinct integers not exceeding nn, the vertices in the desired independent set.'
b'If you, however, choose to solve the second problem, then on the first line print 22, followed by a line containing one integer, cc, representing the length of the found cycle, followed by a line containing cc distinct integers not exceeding nn, the vertices in the desired cycle, in the order they appear in the cycle.'
