b"Vasya is a regular participant at programming contests and is already experienced in finding important sentences in long statements. Of course, numbers constraints are important\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 factorization of a number less than 1000000 is easier than of a number less than 1000000000. However, sometimes it's hard to understand the number at the first glance. Could it be shortened? For example, instead of 1000000 you could write 106106, instead of 1000000000 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94109109, instead of 1000000007\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 109+7109+7."
b'Vasya decided that, to be concise, the notation should follow several rules: '
b'  the notation should only consist of numbers, operations of addition ("+"), multiplication ("*") and exponentiation ("^"), in particular, the use of braces is forbidden;  the use of several exponentiation operations in a row is forbidden, for example, writing "2^3^4" is unacceptable;  the value of the resulting expression equals to the initial number;  the notation should consist of the minimal amount of symbols. '
b'Given nn, find the equivalent concise notation for it.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410000000000).'
b'Output'
b'Output a concise notation of the number nn. If there are several concise notations, output any of them.'
