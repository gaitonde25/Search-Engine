b'The graph is called tree if it is connected and has no cycles. Suppose the tree is rooted at some vertex. Then tree is called to be perfect kk-ary tree if each vertex is either a leaf (has no children) or has exactly kk children. Also, in perfect kk-ary tree all leafs must have same depth.'
b'For example, the picture below illustrates perfect binary tree with 1515 vertices:'
b''
b"There is a perfect kk-ary tree with nn nodes. The nodes are labeled with distinct integers from 11 to nn, however you don't know how nodes are labelled. Still, you want to find the label of the root of the tree."
b'You are allowed to make at most 60\xe2\x8b\x85n60\xe2\x8b\x85n queries of the following type:'
b'  "? aa bb cc", the query returns "Yes" if node with label bb lies on the path from aa to cc and "No" otherwise. '
b'Both aa and cc are considered to be lying on the path from aa to cc.'
b'When you are ready to report the root of the tree, print '
b'  "! ss", where ss is the label of the root of the tree. '
b'It is possible to report the root only once and this query is not counted towards limit of 60\xe2\x8b\x85n60\xe2\x8b\x85n queries.'
