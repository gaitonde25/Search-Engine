b'Consider 2n rows of the seats in a bus. n rows of the seats on the left and n rows of the seats on the right. Each row can be filled by two people. So the total capacity of the bus is 4n.'
b'Consider that m (m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x894n) people occupy the seats in the bus. The passengers entering the bus are numbered from 1 to m (in the order of their entering the bus). The pattern of the seat occupation is as below:'
b'1-st row left window seat, 1-st row right window seat, 2-nd row left window seat, 2-nd row right window seat, ... , n-th row left window seat, n-th row right window seat.'
b'After occupying all the window seats (for m\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x892n) the non-window seats are occupied:'
b'1-st row left non-window seat, 1-st row right non-window seat, ... , n-th row left non-window seat, n-th row right non-window seat.'
b'All the passengers go to a single final destination. In the final destination, the passengers get off in the given order.'
b'1-st row left non-window seat, 1-st row left window seat, 1-st row right non-window seat, 1-st row right window seat, ... , n-th row left non-window seat, n-th row left window seat, n-th row right non-window seat, n-th row right window seat.'
b'  The seating for n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x899 and m\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8936. '
b'You are given the values n and m. Output m numbers from 1 to m, the order in which the passengers will get off the bus.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains two integers, n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100,\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x894n) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pairs of rows and the number of passengers.'
b'Output'
b'Print m distinct integers from 1 to m \xe2\x80\x94 the order in which the passengers will get off the bus.'
