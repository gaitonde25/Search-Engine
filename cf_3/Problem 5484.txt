b"Little Vova studies programming in an elite school. Vova and his classmates are supposed to write n progress tests, for each test they will get a mark from 1 to p. Vova is very smart and he can write every test for any mark, but he doesn't want to stand out from the crowd too much. If the sum of his marks for all tests exceeds value x, then his classmates notice how smart he is and start distracting him asking to let them copy his homework. And if the median of his marks will be lower than y points (the definition of a median is given in the notes), then his mom will decide that he gets too many bad marks and forbid him to play computer games."
b"Vova has already wrote k tests and got marks a1,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89ak. He doesn't want to get into the first or the second situation described above and now he needs to determine which marks he needs to get for the remaining tests. Help him do that."
b'Input'
b"The first line contains 5 space-separated integers: n, k, p, x and y (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89999, n is odd, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89n, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89p\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891000, n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xc2\xb7p, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89p). Here n is the number of tests that Vova is planned to write, k is the number of tests he has already written, p is the maximum possible mark for a test, x is the maximum total number of points so that the classmates don't yet disturb Vova, y is the minimum median point so that mom still lets him play computer games."
b'The second line contains k space-separated integers: a1,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89ak (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89p)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the marks that Vova got for the tests he has already written.'
b'Output'
b'If Vova cannot achieve the desired result, print "-1".'
b'Otherwise, print n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89k space-separated integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the marks that Vova should get for the remaining tests. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.'
