b'"Duel!"'
b'Betting on the lovely princess Claris, the duel between Tokitsukaze and Quailty has started.'
b"There are nn cards in a row. Each card has two sides, one of which has color. At first, some of these cards are with color sides facing up and others are with color sides facing down. Then they take turns flipping cards, in which Tokitsukaze moves first. In each move, one should choose exactly kk consecutive cards and flip them to the same side, which means to make their color sides all face up or all face down. If all the color sides of these nn cards face the same direction after one's move, the one who takes this move will win."
b"Princess Claris wants to know who will win the game if Tokitsukaze and Quailty are so clever that they won't make mistakes."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The second line contains a single string of length nn that only consists of 00 and 11, representing the situation of these nn cards, where the color side of the ii-th card faces up if the ii-th character is 11, or otherwise, it faces down and the ii-th character is 00.'
b'Output'
b'Print "once again" (without quotes) if the total number of their moves can exceed 109109, which is considered a draw.'
b'In other cases, print "tokitsukaze" (without quotes) if Tokitsukaze will win, or "quailty" (without quotes) if Quailty will win.'
b'Note that the output characters are case-sensitive, and any wrong spelling would be rejected.'
