b'Find the minimum area of a square land on which you can place two identical rectangular a\xc3\x97ba\xc3\x97b houses. The sides of the houses should be parallel to the sides of the desired square land.'
b'Formally, '
b'  You are given two identical rectangles with side lengths aa and bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 positive integers (you are given just the sizes, but not their positions).  Find the square of the minimum area that contains both given rectangles. Rectangles can be rotated (both or just one), moved, but the sides of the rectangles should be parallel to the sides of the desired square. '
b'Two rectangles can touch each other (side or corner), but cannot intersect. Rectangles can also touch the sides of the square but must be completely inside it. You can rotate the rectangles. Take a look at the examples for a better understanding.'
b'  The picture shows a square that contains red and green rectangles. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case is a line containing two integers aa, bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 side lengths of the rectangles.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt answers to the test cases. Each answer must be a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 minimal area of square land, that contains two rectangles with dimensions a\xc3\x97ba\xc3\x97b.'
