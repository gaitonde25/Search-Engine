b'Many years have passed, and n friends met at a party again. Technologies have leaped forward since the last meeting, cameras with timer appeared and now it is not obligatory for one of the friends to stand with a camera, and, thus, being absent on the photo.'
b'Simply speaking, the process of photographing can be described as follows. Each friend occupies a rectangle of pixels on the photo: the i-th of them in a standing state occupies a wi pixels wide and a hi pixels high rectangle. But also, each person can lie down for the photo, and then he will occupy a hi pixels wide and a wi pixels high rectangle.'
b"The total photo will have size W\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89H, where W is the total width of all the people rectangles, and H is the maximum of the heights. The friends want to determine what minimum area the group photo can they obtain if no more than n\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x892 of them can lie on the ground (it would be strange if more than n\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x892 gentlemen lie on the ground together, isn't it?..)"
b'Help them to achieve this goal.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of friends.'
b'The next n lines have two integers wi,\xe2\x80\x89hi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89wi,\xe2\x80\x89hi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891000) each, representing the size of the rectangle, corresponding to the i-th friend.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer equal to the minimum possible area of the photo containing all friends if no more than n\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x892 of them can lie on the ground.'
