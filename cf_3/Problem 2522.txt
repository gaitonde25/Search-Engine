b'You are given a graph with 3\xe2\x8b\x85n3\xe2\x8b\x85n vertices and mm edges. You are to find a matching of nn edges, or an independent set of nn vertices.'
b'A set of edges is called a matching if no two edges share an endpoint.'
b'A set of vertices is called an independent set if no two vertices are connected with an edge.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer T\xe2\x89\xa51T\xe2\x89\xa51\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of graphs you need to process. The description of TT graphs follows.'
b'The first line of description of a single graph contains two integers nn and mm, where 3\xe2\x8b\x85n3\xe2\x8b\x85n is the number of vertices, and mm is the number of edges in the graph (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851050\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two integers vivi and uiui (1\xe2\x89\xa4vi,ui\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi,ui\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85n), meaning that there is an edge between vertices vivi and uiui.'
b'It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops and no multiple edges in the graph.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of all nn over all graphs in a single test does not exceed 105105, and the sum of all mm over all graphs in a single test does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'Print your answer for each of the TT graphs. Output your answer for a single graph in the following format.'
b'If you found a matching of size nn, on the first line print "Matching" (without quotes), and on the second line print nn integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the indices of the edges in the matching. The edges are numbered from 11 to mm in the input order.'
b'If you found an independent set of size nn, on the first line print "IndSet" (without quotes), and on the second line print nn integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the indices of the vertices in the independent set.'
b'If there is no matching and no independent set of the specified size, print "Impossible" (without quotes).'
b'You can print edges and vertices in any order.'
b'If there are several solutions, print any. In particular, if there are both a matching of size nn, and an independent set of size nn, then you should print exactly one of such matchings or exactly one of such independent sets.'
