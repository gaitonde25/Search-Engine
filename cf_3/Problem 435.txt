b'You are given an array of integers aa of length nn. The elements of the array can be either different or the same. '
b'Each element of the array is colored either blue or red. There are no unpainted elements in the array. One of the two operations described below can be applied to an array in a single step:'
b'  either you can select any blue element and decrease its value by 11;  or you can select any red element and increase its value by 11. '
b'Situations in which there are no elements of some color at all are also possible. For example, if the whole array is colored blue or red, one of the operations becomes unavailable.'
b'Determine whether it is possible to make 00 or more steps such that the resulting array is a permutation of numbers from 11 to nn?'
b'In other words, check whether there exists a sequence of steps (possibly empty) such that after applying it, the array aa contains in some order all numbers from 11 to nn (inclusive), each exactly once.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of input data sets in the test.'
b'The description of each set of input data consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the original array aa. The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the array elements themselves.'
b"The third line has length nn and consists exclusively of the letters 'B' and/or 'R': iith character is 'B' if aiai is colored blue, and is 'R' if colored red."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all input sets does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case of the input. Print YES as an answer if the corresponding array can be transformed into a permutation, and NO otherwise.'
b'You can print the answer in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will be recognized as a positive answer).'
