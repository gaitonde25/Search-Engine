b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100000), the number of test cases. Then description of tt test cases follow, where each description is as follows:'
b'The first line contains integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4106), the number of Catowice residents and the number of friendship pairs between residents and cats.'
b"Each of the next mm lines contains integers aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n), denoting that aiai-th resident is acquaintances with bibi-th cat. It's guaranteed that each pair of some resident and some cat is listed at most once."
b"It's guaranteed, that for every ii there exists a pair between ii-th resident and ii-th cat."
b'Different test cases are separated with an empty line.'
b"It's guaranteed, that the sum of nn over all test cases is at most 106106 and that the sum of mm over all test cases is at most 106106."
b'Output'
b'For every test case print:'
b'  "No", if it\'s impossible to select the jury and contestants.  Otherwise print "Yes".In the second line print two integers jj and pp (1\xe2\x89\xa4j1\xe2\x89\xa4j, 1\xe2\x89\xa4p1\xe2\x89\xa4p, j+p=nj+p=n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of jury members and the number of contest participants.In the third line print jj distinct integers from 11 to nn, the indices of the residents forming a jury.In the fourth line print pp distinct integers from 11 to nn, the indices of the cats, which will participate in the contest.In case there are several correct answers, print any of them.
