b'You are given an undirected graph of nn vertices indexed from 11 to nn, where vertex ii has a value aiai assigned to it and all values aiai are different. There is an edge between two vertices uu and vv if either auau divides avav or avav divides auau.'
b'Find the minimum number of vertices to remove such that the remaining graph is bipartite, when you remove a vertex you remove all the edges incident to it.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the graph.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers, the ii-th of them is the value aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104) assigned to the ii-th vertex, all values aiai are different.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851045\xe2\x8b\x85104.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of vertices to remove such that the remaining graph is bipartite.'
