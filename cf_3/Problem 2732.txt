b'There are nn people in a row. The height of the ii-th person is aiai. You can choose any subset of these people and try to arrange them into a balanced circle.'
b'A balanced circle is such an order of people that the difference between heights of any adjacent people is no more than 11. For example, let heights of chosen people be [ai1,ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aik][ai1,ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aik], where kk is the number of people you choose. Then the condition |aij\xe2\x88\x92aij+1|\xe2\x89\xa41|aij\xe2\x88\x92aij+1|\xe2\x89\xa41 should be satisfied for all jj from 11 to k\xe2\x88\x921k\xe2\x88\x921 and the condition |ai1\xe2\x88\x92aik|\xe2\x89\xa41|ai1\xe2\x88\x92aik|\xe2\x89\xa41 should be also satisfied. |x||x| means the absolute value of xx. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced.'
b'Your task is to choose the maximum number of people and construct a balanced circle consisting of all chosen people. It is obvious that the circle consisting of one person is balanced so the answer always exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of people.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105), where aiai is the height of the ii-th person.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line of the output print kk \xe2\x80\x94 the number of people in the maximum balanced circle.'
b'In the second line print kk integers res1,res2,\xe2\x80\xa6,reskres1,res2,\xe2\x80\xa6,resk, where resjresj is the height of the jj-th person in the maximum balanced circle. The condition |resj\xe2\x88\x92resj+1|\xe2\x89\xa41|resj\xe2\x88\x92resj+1|\xe2\x89\xa41 should be satisfied for all jj from 11 to k\xe2\x88\x921k\xe2\x88\x921 and the condition |res1\xe2\x88\x92resk|\xe2\x89\xa41|res1\xe2\x88\x92resk|\xe2\x89\xa41 should be also satisfied.'
