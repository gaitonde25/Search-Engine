b"A football league has recently begun in Beautiful land. There are nn teams participating in the league. Let's enumerate them with integers from 11 to nn."
b'There will be played exactly n(n\xe2\x88\x921)2n(n\xe2\x88\x921)2 matches: each team will play against all other teams exactly once. In each match, there is always a winner and loser and there is no draw.'
b"After all matches are played, the organizers will count the number of beautiful triples. Let's call a triple of three teams (A,B,C)(A,B,C) beautiful if a team AA win against a team BB, a team BB win against a team CC and a team CC win against a team AA. We look only to a triples of different teams and the order of teams in the triple is important."
b'The beauty of the league is the number of beautiful triples.'
b'At the moment, mm matches were played and their results are known.'
b'What is the maximum beauty of the league that can be, after playing all remaining matches? Also find a possible results for all remaining n(n\xe2\x88\x921)2\xe2\x88\x92mn(n\xe2\x88\x921)2\xe2\x88\x92m matches, so that the league has this maximum beauty.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n,mn,m (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450,0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n(n\xe2\x88\x921)23\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450,0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n(n\xe2\x88\x921)2)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of teams in the football league and the number of matches that were played.'
b'Each of mm following lines contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n, u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v) denoting that the uu-th team won against the vv-th team. It is guaranteed that each unordered pair of teams appears at most once.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn lines, each line having a string of exactly nn characters. Each character must be either 00 or 11.'
b'Let aijaij be the jj-th number in the ii-th line. For all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n it should be true, that aii=0aii=0. For all pairs of teams i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j the number aijaij indicates the result of the match between the ii-th team and the jj-th team:'
b'  If aijaij is 11, the ii-th team wins against the jj-th team;  Otherwise the jj-th team wins against the ii-th team;  Also, it should be true, that aij+aji=1aij+aji=1. '
b'Also note that the results of the mm matches that were already played cannot be changed in your league.'
b'The beauty of the league in the output should be maximum possible. If there are multiple possible answers with maximum beauty, you can print any of them.'
