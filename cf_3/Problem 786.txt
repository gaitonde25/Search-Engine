b'2k2k teams participate in a playoff tournament. The tournament consists of 2k\xe2\x88\x9212k\xe2\x88\x921 games. They are held as follows: first of all, the teams are split into pairs: team 11 plays against team 22, team 33 plays against team 44 (exactly in this order), and so on (so, 2k\xe2\x88\x9212k\xe2\x88\x921 games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only 2k\xe2\x88\x9212k\xe2\x88\x921 teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, 2k\xe2\x88\x9222k\xe2\x88\x922 games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game "11 vs 22" plays against the winner of the game "33 vs 44", then the winner of the game "55 vs 66" plays against the winner of the game "77 vs 88", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.'
b'For example, this picture describes the chronological order of games with k=3k=3:'
b'  '
b'Let the string ss consisting of 2k\xe2\x88\x9212k\xe2\x88\x921 characters describe the results of the games in chronological order as follows:'
b'  if sisi is 0, then the team with lower index wins the ii-th game;  if sisi is 1, then the team with greater index wins the ii-th game;  if sisi is ?, then the result of the ii-th game is unknown (any team could win this game). '
b'Let f(s)f(s) be the number of possible winners of the tournament described by the string ss. A team ii is a possible winner of the tournament if it is possible to replace every ? with either 1 or 0 in such a way that team ii is the champion.'
b'You are given the initial state of the string ss. You have to process qq queries of the following form: '
b'  pp cc\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 replace spsp with character cc, and print f(s)f(s) as the result of the query. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4181\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa418).'
b'The second line contains a string consisting of 2k\xe2\x88\x9212k\xe2\x88\x921 characters\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial state of the string ss. Each character is either ?, 0, or 1.'
b'The third line contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'Then qq lines follow, the ii-th line contains an integer pp and a character cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa42k\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa42k\xe2\x88\x921; cc is either ?, 0, or 1), describing the ii-th query.'
b'Output'
b'For each query, print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 f(s)f(s).'
