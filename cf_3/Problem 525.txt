b'Omkar is hosting tours of his country, Omkarland! There are nn cities in Omkarland, and, rather curiously, there are exactly n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 bidirectional roads connecting the cities to each other. It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.'
b'Every city has an enjoyment value ee. Each road has a capacity cc, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll tt. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay maxtmaxt over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 00 toll.'
b'Omkar has decided to host qq tour groups. Each tour group consists of vv vehicles starting at city xx. (Keep in mind that a tour group with vv vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity \xe2\x89\xa5v\xe2\x89\xa5v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city yy with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from xx to yy? (This trip from xx to yy will always be on the shortest path from xx to yy.)'
b'In the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and qq (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.'
b'The next line contains nn integers e1,e2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ene1,e2,\xe2\x80\xa6,en (1\xe2\x89\xa4ei\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ei\xe2\x89\xa4109), where eiei represents the enjoyment value for city ii.'
b'The next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines each contain four integers aa, bb, cc, and tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4109), representing an road between city aa and city bb with capacity cc and toll tt.'
b'The next qq lines each contain two integers vv and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Output qq lines. The ii-th line should contain two integers: the highest possible enjoyment value of a city reachable by the ii-th tour group, and the amount of money per vehicle Omkar needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the ii-th tour group.'
