b'So we got bored and decided to take our own guess at how would "Inception" production go if the budget for the film had been terribly low.'
b'The first scene we remembered was the one that features the whole city bending onto itself:'
b'  '
b"It feels like it will require high CGI expenses, doesn't it? Luckily, we came up with a similar-looking scene which was a tiny bit cheaper to make."
b"Firstly, forget about 3D, that's hard and expensive! The city is now represented as a number line (infinite to make it easier, of course)."
b"Secondly, the city doesn't have to look natural at all. There are nn buildings on the line. Each building is a square 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971. Buildings are numbered from 11 to nn in ascending order of their positions. Lower corners of building ii are at integer points aiai and ai+1ai+1 of the number line. Also the distance between any two neighbouring buildings ii and i+1i+1 doesn't exceed dd (really, this condition is here just to make the city look not that sparse). Distance between some neighbouring buildings ii and i+1i+1 is calculated from the lower right corner of building ii to the lower left corner of building i+1i+1."
b'Finally, curvature of the bend is also really hard to simulate! Let the bend at some integer coordinate xx be performed with the following algorithm. Take the ray from xx to +\xe2\x88\x9e+\xe2\x88\x9e and all the buildings which are on this ray and start turning the ray and the buildings counter-clockwise around point xx. At some angle some building will touch either another building or a part of the line. You have to stop bending there (implementing buildings crushing is also not worth its money). '
b"Let's call the angle between two rays in the final state the terminal angle \xce\xb1x\xce\xb1x."
b"The only thing left is to decide what integer point xx is the best to start bending around. Fortunately, we've already chosen mm candidates to perform the bending."
b'So, can you please help us to calculate terminal angle \xce\xb1x\xce\xb1x for each bend xx from our list of candidates?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integer numbers nn and dd (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa470000\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa47000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of buildings and the maximum distance between any pair of neighbouring buildings, respectively.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (a1=0a1=0, 0<ai+1\xe2\x88\x92ai\xe2\x89\xa4d+10<ai+1\xe2\x88\x92ai\xe2\x89\xa4d+1) \xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of left corners of corresponding buildings in ascending order.'
b'The third line contains single integer mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candidates.'
b'The fourth line contains mm integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xmx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xm (0\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4an+10\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4an+1, xi<xi+1xi<xi+1) \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of bends you need to calculate terminal angles for in ascending order.'
b'Output'
b'Print mm numbers. For each bend xixi print terminal angle \xce\xb1xi\xce\xb1xi (in radians).'
b'Your answer is considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92910\xe2\x88\x929.'
b"Formally, let your answer be aa, and the jury's answer be bb. Your answer is accepted if and only if |a\xe2\x88\x92b|\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x929|a\xe2\x88\x92b|\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x929."
