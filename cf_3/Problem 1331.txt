b"Recently a new building with a new layout was constructed in Monocarp's hometown. According to this new layout, the building consists of three types of apartments: three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. It's also known that each room of each apartment has exactly one window. In other words, a three-room apartment has three windows, a five-room\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 five windows, and a seven-room\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 seven windows."
b'Monocarp went around the building and counted nn windows. Now he is wondering, how many apartments of each type the building may have.'
b'Unfortunately, Monocarp only recently has learned to count, so he is asking you to help him to calculate the possible quantities of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments in the building that has nn windows. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.'
b'Here are some examples:'
b'  if Monocarp has counted 3030 windows, there could have been 22 three-room apartments, 22 five-room apartments and 22 seven-room apartments, since 2\xe2\x8b\x853+2\xe2\x8b\x855+2\xe2\x8b\x857=302\xe2\x8b\x853+2\xe2\x8b\x855+2\xe2\x8b\x857=30;  if Monocarp has counted 6767 windows, there could have been 77 three-room apartments, 55 five-room apartments and 33 seven-room apartments, since 7\xe2\x8b\x853+5\xe2\x8b\x855+3\xe2\x8b\x857=677\xe2\x8b\x853+5\xe2\x8b\x855+3\xe2\x8b\x857=67;  if Monocarp has counted 44 windows, he should have mistaken since no building with the aforementioned layout can have 44 windows. '
b'Input'
b'Th first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The only line of each test case contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of windows in the building.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, if a building with the new layout and the given number of windows just can't exist, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921."
b'Otherwise, print three non-negative integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the possible number of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
