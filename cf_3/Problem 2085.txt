b"Kiwon's favorite video game is now holding a new year event to motivate the users! The game is about building and defending a castle, which led Kiwon to think about the following puzzle."
b'In a 2-dimension plane, you have a set s={(x1,y1),(x2,y2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(xn,yn)}s={(x1,y1),(x2,y2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(xn,yn)} consisting of nn distinct points. In the set ss, no three distinct points lie on a single line. For a point p\xe2\x88\x88sp\xe2\x88\x88s, we can protect this point by building a castle. A castle is a simple quadrilateral (polygon with 44 vertices) that strictly encloses the point pp (i.e. the point pp is strictly inside a quadrilateral). '
b'Kiwon is interested in the number of 44-point subsets of ss that can be used to build a castle protecting pp. Note that, if a single subset can be connected in more than one way to enclose a point, it is counted only once. '
b'Let f(p)f(p) be the number of 44-point subsets that can enclose the point pp. Please compute the sum of f(p)f(p) for all points p\xe2\x88\x88sp\xe2\x88\x88s.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (5\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa425005\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42500).'
b'In the next nn lines, two integers xixi and yiyi (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109) denoting the position of points are given.'
b'It is guaranteed that all points are distinct, and there are no three collinear points.'
b'Output'
b'Print the sum of f(p)f(p) for all points p\xe2\x88\x88sp\xe2\x88\x88s.'
