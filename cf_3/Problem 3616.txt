b'You are given a special connected undirected graph where each vertex belongs to at most one simple cycle.'
b'Your task is to remove as many edges as needed to convert this graph into a tree (connected graph with no cycles). '
b'For each node, independently, output the maximum distance between it and a leaf in the resulting tree, assuming you were to remove the edges in a way that minimizes this distance.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105), the number of nodes and the number of edges, respectively.'
b'Each of the following mm lines contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n, u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v), and represents an edge connecting the two nodes uu and vv. Each pair of nodes is connected by at most one edge.'
b'It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected and each vertex belongs to at most one simple cycle.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn space-separated integers, the ii-th integer represents the maximum distance between node ii and a leaf if the removed edges were chosen in a way that minimizes this distance.'
