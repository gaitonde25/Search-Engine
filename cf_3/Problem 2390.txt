b'Alice became interested in periods of integer numbers. We say positive XX integer number is periodic with length LL if there exists positive integer number PP with LL digits such that XX can be written as PPPP\xe2\x80\xa6PPPPP\xe2\x80\xa6P. For example:'
b'X=123123123X=123123123 is periodic number with length L=3L=3 and L=9L=9'
b'X=42424242X=42424242 is periodic number with length L=2,L=4L=2,L=4 and L=8L=8'
b'X=12345X=12345 is periodic number with length L=5L=5'
b'For given positive period length LL and positive integer number AA, Alice wants to find smallest integer number XX strictly greater than AA that is periodic with length L.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains one positive integer number L\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4105)L\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4105) representing length of the period. Second line contains one positive integer number A\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa410100000)A\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa410100000).'
b'Output'
b'One positive integer number representing smallest positive number that is periodic with length LL and is greater than AA.'
