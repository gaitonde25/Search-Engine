b'In the 20222022 year, Mike found two binary integers aa and bb of length nn (both of them are written only by digits 00 and 11) that can have leading zeroes. In order not to forget them, he wanted to construct integer dd in the following way: '
b"  he creates an integer cc as a result of bitwise summing of aa and bb without transferring carry, so cc may have one or more 22-s. For example, the result of bitwise summing of 01100110 and 11011101 is 12111211 or the sum of 011000011000 and 011000011000 is 022000022000;  after that Mike replaces equal consecutive digits in cc by one digit, thus getting dd. In the cases above after this operation, 12111211 becomes 121121 and 022000022000 becomes 020020 (so, dd won't have equal consecutive digits). "
b'Unfortunately, Mike lost integer aa before he could calculate dd himself. Now, to cheer him up, you want to find any binary integer aa of length nn such that dd will be maximum possible as integer.'
b'Maximum possible as integer means that 102>21102>21, 012<101012<101, 021=21021=21 and so on.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains the integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of aa and bb.'
b'The second line of each test case contains binary integer bb of length nn. The integer bb consists only of digits 00 and 11.'
b"It is guaranteed that the total sum of nn over all tt test cases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case output one binary integer aa of length nn. Note, that aa or bb may have leading zeroes but must have the same length nn.'
