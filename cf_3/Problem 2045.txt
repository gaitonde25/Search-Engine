b'3R2 - Standby for Action'
b'Our dear Cafe\'s owner, JOE Miller, will soon take part in a new game TV-show "1 vs. nn"!'
b'The game goes in rounds, where in each round the host asks JOE and his opponents a common question. All participants failing to answer are eliminated. The show ends when only JOE remains (we assume that JOE never answers a question wrong!).'
b'For each question JOE answers, if there are ss (s>0s>0) opponents remaining and tt (0\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4s0\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4s) of them make a mistake on it, JOE receives tsts dollars, and consequently there will be s\xe2\x88\x92ts\xe2\x88\x92t opponents left for the next question.'
b'JOE wonders what is the maximum possible reward he can receive in the best possible scenario. Yet he has little time before show starts, so can you help him answering it instead?'
b'Input'
b"The first and single line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105), denoting the number of JOE's opponents in the show."
b'Output'
b'Print a number denoting the maximum prize (in dollars) JOE could have.'
b"Your answer will be considered correct if it's absolute or relative error won't exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92410\xe2\x88\x924. In other words, if your answer is aa and the jury answer is bb, then it must hold that |a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,b)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x924|a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,b)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x924."
