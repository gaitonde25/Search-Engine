b"A girl named Sonya is studying in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland. The teacher of computer science (Sonya's favorite subject!) invented a task for her."
b'Given an array aa of length nn, consisting only of the numbers 00 and 11, and the number kk. Exactly kk times the following happens: '
b'  Two numbers ii and jj are chosen equiprobable such that (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n).  The numbers in the ii and jj positions are swapped. '
b"Sonya's task is to find the probability that after all the operations are completed, the aa array will be sorted in non-decreasing order. She turned to you for help. Help Sonya solve this problem."
b'It can be shown that the desired probability is either 00 or it can be represented as PQPQ, where PP and QQ are coprime integers and Q\xe2\x89\xa1\xcc\xb80\xc2\xa0(mod109+7)Q\xe2\x89\xa20\xc2\xa0(mod109+7).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the array aa and the number of operations.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the description of the array aa.'
b'Output'
b'If the desired probability is 00, print 00, otherwise print the value P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 (mod109+7)(mod109+7), where PP and QQ are defined above.'
