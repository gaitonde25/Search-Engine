b"Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by 33 or end with the digit 33 in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too."
b'Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 00) integers which he likes: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,16,\xe2\x80\xa61,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,16,\xe2\x80\xa6. Output the kk-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 11).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case consists of one line containing one integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41000).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output in a separate line one integer xx \xe2\x80\x94 the kk-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.'
