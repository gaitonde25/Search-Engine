b'You came to a local shop and want to buy some chocolate bars. There are nn bars in the shop, ii-th of them costs aiai coins (and you want to buy all of them).'
b'You have mm different coupons that allow you to buy chocolate bars. ii-th coupon allows you to buy qiqi chocolate bars while you have to pay only for the qi\xe2\x88\x921qi\xe2\x88\x921 most expensive ones (so, the cheapest bar of those qiqi bars is for free).'
b'You can use only one coupon; if you use coupon ii, you have to choose qiqi bars and buy them using the coupon, and buy all the remaining n\xe2\x88\x92qin\xe2\x88\x92qi bars without any discounts.'
b'To decide which coupon to choose, you want to know what will be the minimum total amount of money you have to pay if you use one of the coupons optimally.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of chocolate bars in the shop.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109), where aiai is the cost of ii-th chocolate bar.'
b'The third line contains one integer mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of coupons you have.'
b'The fourth line contains mm integers q1q1, q2q2, ..., qmqm (2\xe2\x89\xa4qi\xe2\x89\xa4n2\xe2\x89\xa4qi\xe2\x89\xa4n), where qiqi is the number of chocolate bars you have to buy using ii-th coupon so that the least expensive of them will be for free. All values of qiqi are pairwise distinct.'
b'Output'
b'Print mm integers, ii-th of them should be the minimum amount of money you have to pay if you buy qiqi bars with ii-th coupon, and all the remaining bars one by one for their full price.'
