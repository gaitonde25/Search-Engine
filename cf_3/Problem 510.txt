b'Omkar is creating a mosaic using colored square tiles, which he places in an n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n grid. When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid will have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only placed tiles in some cells. '
b'A completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly 22 tiles of the same color (22 tiles are adjacent if they share a side.) Omkar wants to fill the rest of the tiles so that the mosaic becomes a mastapeece. Now he is wondering, is the way to do this unique, and if it is, what is it?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000).'
b"Then follow nn lines with nn characters in each line. The ii-th character in the jj-th line corresponds to the cell in row ii and column jj of the grid, and will be SS if Omkar has placed a sinoper tile in this cell, GG if Omkar has placed a glaucous tile, .. if it's empty. "
b'Output'
b'On the first line, print UNIQUE if there is a unique way to get a mastapeece, NONE if Omkar cannot create any, and MULTIPLE if there is more than one way to do so. All letters must be uppercase.'
b'If you print UNIQUE, then print nn additional lines with nn characters in each line, such that the ii-th character in the jthjth line is SS if the tile in row ii and column jj of the mastapeece is sinoper, and GG if it is glaucous. '
