b"Acingel is a small town. There was only one doctor here\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Miss Ada. She was very friendly and nobody has ever said something bad about her, so who could've expected that Ada will be found dead in her house? Mr Gawry, world-famous detective, is appointed to find the criminal. He asked mm neighbours of Ada about clients who have visited her in that unlucky day. Let's number the clients from 11 to nn. Each neighbour's testimony is a permutation of these numbers, which describes the order in which clients have been seen by the asked neighbour."
b'However, some facts are very suspicious\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 how it is that, according to some of given permutations, some client has been seen in the morning, while in others he has been seen in the evening? "In the morning some of neighbours must have been sleeping!"\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 thinks Gawry\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 "and in the evening there\'s been too dark to see somebody\'s face...". Now he wants to delete some prefix and some suffix (both prefix and suffix can be empty) in each permutation, so that they\'ll be non-empty and equal to each other after that\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 some of the potential criminals may disappear, but the testimony won\'t stand in contradiction to each other.'
b'In how many ways he can do it? Two ways are called different if the remaining common part is different.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of suspects and the number of asked neighbors.'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n). It is guaranteed that these integers form a correct permutation (that is, each number from 11 to nn appears exactly once).'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer denoting the number of ways to delete some prefix and some suffix of each permutation (possibly empty), such that the remaining parts will be equal and non-empty.'
