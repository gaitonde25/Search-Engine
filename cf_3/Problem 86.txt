b'You are given a board with nn rows and nn columns, numbered from 11 to nn. The intersection of the aa-th row and bb-th column is denoted by (a,b)(a,b).'
b'A half-queen attacks cells in the same row, same column, and on one diagonal. More formally, a half-queen on (a,b)(a,b) attacks the cell (c,d)(c,d) if a=ca=c or b=db=d or a\xe2\x88\x92b=c\xe2\x88\x92da\xe2\x88\x92b=c\xe2\x88\x92d.'
b'  The blue cells are under attack. '
b' What is the minimum number of half-queens that can be placed on that board so as to ensure that each square is attacked by at least one half-queen?'
b'Construct an optimal solution.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the board.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print a single integer kk \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of half-queens.'
b'In each of the next kk lines print two integers aiai, bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the position of the ii-th half-queen.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, print any.'
