b'A game field is a strip of 1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89n square cells. In some cells there are Packmen, in some cells\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 asterisks, other cells are empty.'
b"Packman can move to neighboring cell in 1 time unit. If there is an asterisk in the target cell then Packman eats it. Packman doesn't spend any time to eat an asterisk."
b'In the initial moment of time all Packmen begin to move. Each Packman can change direction of its move unlimited number of times, but it is not allowed to go beyond the boundaries of the game field. Packmen do not interfere with the movement of other packmen; in one cell there can be any number of packmen moving in any directions.'
b'Your task is to determine minimum possible time after which Packmen can eat all the asterisks.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the game field.'
b"The second line contains the description of the game field consisting of n symbols. If there is symbol '.' in position i \xe2\x80\x94 the cell i is empty. If there is symbol '*' in position i \xe2\x80\x94 in the cell i contains an asterisk. If there is symbol 'P' in position i \xe2\x80\x94 Packman is in the cell i."
b'It is guaranteed that on the game field there is at least one Packman and at least one asterisk.'
b'Output'
b'Print minimum possible time after which Packmen can eat all asterisks.'
