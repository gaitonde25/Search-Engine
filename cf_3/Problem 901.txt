b"Phoenix's homeland, the Fire Nation had nn cities that were connected by mm roads, but the roads were all destroyed by an earthquake. The Fire Nation wishes to repair n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 of these roads so that all the cities are connected again. "
b'The ii-th city has aiai tons of asphalt. xx tons of asphalt are used up when repairing a road, and to repair a road between ii and jj, cities ii and jj must have at least xx tons of asphalt between them. In other words, if city ii had aiai tons of asphalt and city jj had ajaj tons, there would remain ai+aj\xe2\x88\x92xai+aj\xe2\x88\x92x tons after repairing the road between them. Asphalt can be moved between cities if the road between them is already repaired.'
b'Please determine if it is possible to connect all the cities, and if so, output any sequence of roads to repair.'
