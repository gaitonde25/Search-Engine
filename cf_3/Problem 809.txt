b'Ivan wants to play a game with you. He picked some string ss of length nn consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. '
b"You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes."
b'Ivan wants you to guess which of the given 2n\xe2\x88\x9222n\xe2\x88\x922 strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer number nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the guessed string ss.'
b'The next 2n\xe2\x88\x9222n\xe2\x88\x922 lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.'
b'It is guaranteed that there are exactly 22 strings of each length from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length nn.'
b'Output'
b"Print one string of length 2n\xe2\x88\x9222n\xe2\x88\x922 \xe2\x80\x94 the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The ii-th character of this string should be 'P' if the ii-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise."
b'If there are several possible answers, you can print any.'
