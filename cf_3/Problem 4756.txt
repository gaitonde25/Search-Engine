b'During the chemistry lesson Andrew learned that the saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) enter into radical chlorination reaction. Andrew is a very curious boy, so he wondered how many different products of the reaction may be forms for a given alkane. He managed to solve the task for small molecules, but for large ones he faced some difficulties and asks you to help.'
b"Formally, you are given a tree consisting of n vertices, such that the degree of each vertex doesn't exceed 4. You have to count the number of distinct non-isomorphic trees that can be obtained by adding to this tree one new vertex and one new edge, such that the graph is still the tree and the degree of each vertex doesn't exceed 4."
b'Two trees are isomorphic if there exists a bijection f(v) such that vertices u and v are connected by an edge if and only if vertices f(v) and f(u) are connected by an edge.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains an integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b"Then follow n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines with edges descriptions. Each edge is given by two integers ui and vi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ui,\xe2\x80\x89vi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 indices of vertices connected by an edge. It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree and the degree of each vertex doesn't exceed 4."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the question.'
