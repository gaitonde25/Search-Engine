b'Polycarp is wondering about buying a new computer, which costs cc tugriks. To do this, he wants to get a job as a programmer in a big company.'
b"There are nn positions in Polycarp's company, numbered starting from one. An employee in position ii earns a[i]a[i] tugriks every day. The higher the position number, the more tugriks the employee receives. Initially, Polycarp gets a position with the number 11 and has 00 tugriks."
b'Each day Polycarp can do one of two things: '
b'  If Polycarp is in the position of xx, then he can earn a[x]a[x] tugriks.  If Polycarp is in the position of xx (x<nx<n) and has at least b[x]b[x] tugriks, then he can spend b[x]b[x] tugriks on an online course and move to the position x+1x+1. '
b'For example, if n=4n=4, c=15c=15, a=[1,3,10,11]a=[1,3,10,11], b=[1,2,7]b=[1,2,7], then Polycarp can act like this: '
b'  On the first day, Polycarp is in the 11-st position and earns 11 tugrik. Now he has 11 tugrik;  On the second day, Polycarp is in the 11-st position and move to the 22-nd position. Now he has 00 tugriks;  On the third day, Polycarp is in the 22-nd position and earns 33 tugriks. Now he has 33 tugriks;  On the fourth day, Polycarp is in the 22-nd position and is transferred to the 33-rd position. Now he has 11 tugriks;  On the fifth day, Polycarp is in the 33-rd position and earns 1010 tugriks. Now he has 1111 tugriks;  On the sixth day, Polycarp is in the 33-rd position and earns 1010 tugriks. Now he has 2121 tugriks;  Six days later, Polycarp can buy himself a new computer. '
b'Find the minimum number of days after which Polycarp will be able to buy himself a new computer.'
