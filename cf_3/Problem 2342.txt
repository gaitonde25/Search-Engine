b'In this problem, a n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m rectangular matrix aa is called increasing if, for each row of ii, when go from left to right, the values strictly increase (that is, ai,1<ai,2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<ai,mai,1<ai,2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<ai,m) and for each column jj, when go from top to bottom, the values strictly increase (that is, a1,j<a2,j<\xe2\x8b\xaf<an,ja1,j<a2,j<\xe2\x8b\xaf<an,j).'
b'In a given matrix of non-negative integers, it is necessary to replace each value of 00 with some positive integer so that the resulting matrix is increasing and the sum of its elements is maximum, or find that it is impossible.'
b'It is guaranteed that in a given value matrix all values of 00 are contained only in internal cells (that is, not in the first or last row and not in the first or last column).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integers nn and mm (3\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa45003\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4500) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns in the given matrix aa.'
b'The following lines contain mm each of non-negative integers \xe2\x80\x94 the values in the corresponding row of the given matrix: ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,mai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,m (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa480000\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa48000).'
b'It is guaranteed that for all ai,j=0ai,j=0, 1<i<n1<i<n and 1<j<m1<j<m are true.'
b'Output'
b'If it is possible to replace all zeros with positive numbers so that the matrix is increasing, print the maximum possible sum of matrix elements. Otherwise, print -1.'
