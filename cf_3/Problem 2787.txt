b'You are given nn objects. Each object has two integer properties: valivali\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 its price\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 and maskimaski. It is guaranteed that the sum of all prices is initially non-zero.'
b'You want to select a positive integer ss. All objects will be modified after that. The ii-th object will be modified using the following procedure: '
b'  Consider maskimaski and ss in binary notation,  Compute the bitwise AND of ss and maskimaski (s&maskis&maski),  If (s&maskis&maski) contains an odd number of ones, replace the valivali with \xe2\x88\x92vali\xe2\x88\x92vali. Otherwise do nothing with the ii-th object. '
b'You need to find such an integer ss that when the modification above is done the sum of all prices changes sign (if it was negative, it should become positive, and vice-versa; it is not allowed for it to become zero). The absolute value of the sum can be arbitrary.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of objects.'
b'The ii-th of next nn lines contains integers valivali and maskimaski (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4vali\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4vali\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4maski\xe2\x89\xa4262\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4maski\xe2\x89\xa4262\xe2\x88\x921)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the price of the object and its mask.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of valivali is initially non-zero.'
b'Output'
b'Print an integer ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4262\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4262\xe2\x88\x921), such that if we modify the objects as described above, the sign of the sum of valivali changes its sign.'
b'If there are multiple such ss, print any of them. One can show that there is always at least one valid ss.'
