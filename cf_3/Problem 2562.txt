b'There are nn points on the plane, the ii-th of which is at (xi,yi)(xi,yi). Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area.'
b'The strange area is enclosed by three lines, x=lx=l, y=ay=a and x=rx=r, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where ll, rr and aa can be any real numbers satisfying that l<rl<r. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the xx-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area.'
b'  '
b'A point (xi,yi)(xi,yi) is in the strange rectangular area if and only if l<xi<rl<xi<r and yi>ayi>a. For example, in the above figure, p1p1 is in the area while p2p2 is not.'
b'Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x971051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x97105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points on the plane.'
b'The ii-th of the next nn lines contains two integers xixi, yiyi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the ii-th point.'
b'All points are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of different non-empty sets of points she can obtain.'
