b'Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.'
b'So imagine Monocarp got recommended nn songs, numbered from 11 to nn. The ii-th song had its predicted rating equal to pipi, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n and every integer from 11 to nn appears exactly once. In other words, pp is a permutation.'
b'After listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string ss, such that si=0si=0 means that he disliked the ii-th song, and si=1si=1 means that he liked it.'
b'Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:'
b'  the new ratings q1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qnq1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qn still form a permutation (1\xe2\x89\xa4qi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4qi\xe2\x89\xa4n; each integer from 11 to nn appears exactly once);  every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all i,ji,j such that si=1si=1 and sj=0sj=0, qi>qjqi>qj should hold). '
b'Among all valid permutations qq find the one that has the smallest value of \xe2\x88\x91i=1n|pi\xe2\x88\x92qi|\xe2\x88\x91i=1n|pi\xe2\x88\x92qi|, where |x||x| is an absolute value of xx.'
b'Print the permutation q1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qnq1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qn. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'The first line of each testcase contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of songs.'
b'The second line of each testcase contains nn integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the permutation of the predicted ratings.'
b'The third line contains a single string ss, consisting of nn characters. Each character is either a 00 or a 11. 00 means that Monocarp disliked the song, and 11 means that he liked it.'
b"The sum of nn over all testcases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase, print a permutation qq\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that \xe2\x88\x91i=1n|pi\xe2\x88\x92qi|\xe2\x88\x91i=1n|pi\xe2\x88\x92qi| is minimum possible, you can print any of them.'
