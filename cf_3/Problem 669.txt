b'  '
b'William has an array of nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. In one move he can swap two neighboring items. Two items aiai and ajaj are considered neighboring if the condition |i\xe2\x88\x92j|=1|i\xe2\x88\x92j|=1 is satisfied.'
b'William wants you to calculate the minimal number of swaps he would need to perform to make it so that the array does not contain two neighboring items with the same parity.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104). Description of the test cases follows.'
b"The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) which is the total number of items in William's array."
b"The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) which are William's array."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output the minimal number of operations needed or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to get the array to a state when no neighboring numbers have the same parity.'
