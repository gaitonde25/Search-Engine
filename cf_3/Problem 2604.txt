b'The rebels have saved enough gold to launch a full-scale attack. Now the situation is flipped, the rebels will send out the spaceships to attack the Empire bases!'
b'The galaxy can be represented as an undirected graph with nn planets (nodes) and mm wormholes (edges), each connecting two planets.'
b'A total of ss rebel spaceships and bb empire bases are located at different planets in the galaxy.'
b'Each spaceship is given a location xx, denoting the index of the planet on which it is located, an attacking strength aa, a certain amount of fuel ff, and a price to operate pp.'
b'Each base is given a location xx, a defensive strength dd, and a certain amount of gold gg.'
b'A spaceship can attack a base if both of these conditions hold: '
b"  the spaceship's attacking strength is greater or equal than the defensive strength of the base  the spaceship's fuel is greater or equal to the shortest distance, computed as the number of wormholes, between the spaceship's node and the base's node "
b'The rebels are very proud fighters. So, if a spaceship cannot attack any base, no rebel pilot will accept to operate it.'
b'If a spaceship is operated, the profit generated by that spaceship is equal to the gold of the base it attacks minus the price to operate the spaceship. Note that this might be negative. A spaceship that is operated will attack the base that maximizes its profit.'
b'Darth Vader likes to appear rich at all times. Therefore, whenever a base is attacked and its gold stolen, he makes sure to immediately refill that base with gold.'
b'Therefore, for the purposes of the rebels, multiple spaceships can attack the same base, in which case each spaceship will still receive all the gold of that base.'
b'The rebels have tasked Heidi and the Doctor to decide which set of spaceships to operate in order to maximize the total profit.'
b'However, as the war has been going on for a long time, the pilots have formed unbreakable bonds, and some of them refuse to operate spaceships if their friends are not also operating spaceships.'
b'They have a list of kk dependencies of the form s1,s2s1,s2, denoting that spaceship s1s1 can be operated only if spaceship s2s2 is also operated.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4100000\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410000), the number of nodes and the number of edges, respectively.'
b'The next mm lines contain integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n) denoting an undirected edge between the two nodes.'
b'The next line contains integers ss, bb and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4s,b\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4s,b\xe2\x89\xa4105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410000\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41000), the number of spaceships, bases, and dependencies, respectively.'
b'The next ss lines contain integers x,a,f,px,a,f,p (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n, 0\xe2\x89\xa4a,f,p\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4a,f,p\xe2\x89\xa4109), denoting the location, attack, fuel, and price of the spaceship. Ships are numbered from 11 to ss.'
b'The next bb lines contain integers x,d,gx,d,g (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n, 0\xe2\x89\xa4d,g\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4d,g\xe2\x89\xa4109), denoting the location, defence, and gold of the base.'
b'The next kk lines contain integers s1s1 and s2s2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4s1,s2\xe2\x89\xa4s1\xe2\x89\xa4s1,s2\xe2\x89\xa4s), denoting a dependency of s1s1 on s2s2.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer, the maximum total profit that can be achieved.'
