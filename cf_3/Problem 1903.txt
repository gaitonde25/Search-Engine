b"It's the year 5555. You have a graph, and you want to find a long cycle and a huge independent set, just because you can. But for now, let's just stick with finding either."
b'Given a connected graph with nn vertices, you can choose to either:'
b'  find an independent set that has exactly \xe2\x8c\x88n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9a\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n\xe2\x8c\x89 vertices. find a simple cycle of length at least \xe2\x8c\x88n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9a\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n\xe2\x8c\x89. '
b"An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof you can always solve one of these problems, but it's too long to fit this margin."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (5\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41055\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices and edges in the graph.'
b"Each of the next mm lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n) that mean there's an edge between vertices uu and vv. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges."
b'Output'
b'If you choose to solve the first problem, then on the first line print "1", followed by a line containing \xe2\x8c\x88n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9a\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n\xe2\x8c\x89 distinct integers not exceeding nn, the vertices in the desired independent set.'
b'If you, however, choose to solve the second problem, then on the first line print "2", followed by a line containing one integer, cc, representing the length of the found cycle, followed by a line containing cc distinct integers integers not exceeding nn, the vertices in the desired cycle, in the order they appear in the cycle.'
