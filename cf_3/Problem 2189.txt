b'A string is called beautiful if no two consecutive characters are equal. For example, "ababcb", "a" and "abab" are beautiful strings, while "aaaaaa", "abaa" and "bb" are not.'
b"Ahcl wants to construct a beautiful string. He has a string ss, consisting of only characters 'a', 'b', 'c' and '?'. Ahcl needs to replace each character '?' with one of the three characters 'a', 'b' or 'c', such that the resulting string is beautiful. Please help him!"
b"More formally, after replacing all characters '?', the condition si\xe2\x89\xa0si+1si\xe2\x89\xa0si+1 should be satisfied for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x88\x921, where |s||s| is the length of the string ss."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains positive integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next tt lines contain the descriptions of test cases.'
b"Each line contains a non-empty string ss consisting of only characters 'a', 'b', 'c' and '?'. "
b"It is guaranteed that in each test case a string ss has at least one character '?'. The sum of lengths of strings ss in all test cases does not exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case given in the input print the answer in the following format:'
b'  If it is impossible to create a beautiful string, print "-1" (without quotes);  Otherwise, print the resulting beautiful string after replacing all \'?\' characters. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. '
