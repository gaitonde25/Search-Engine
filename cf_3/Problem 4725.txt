b'There are n cities located along the one-way road. Cities are numbered from 1 to n in the direction of the road.'
b'The i-th city had produced pi units of goods. No more than si units of goods can be sold in the i-th city.'
b'For each pair of cities i and j such that 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89j\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n you can no more than once transport no more than c units of goods from the city i to the city j. Note that goods can only be transported from a city with a lesser index to the city with a larger index. You can transport goods between cities in any order.'
b'Determine the maximum number of produced goods that can be sold in total in all the cities after a sequence of transportations.'
