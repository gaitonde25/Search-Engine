b'Today Adilbek is taking his probability theory test. Unfortunately, when Adilbek arrived at the university, there had already been a long queue of students wanting to take the same test. Adilbek has estimated that he will be able to start the test only TT seconds after coming. '
b'Fortunately, Adilbek can spend time without revising any boring theorems or formulas. He has an app on this smartphone which contains nn Japanese crosswords to solve. Adilbek has decided to solve them all one by one in the order they are listed in the app, without skipping any crossword. For each crossword, a number titi is given that represents the time it takes an average crossword expert to solve this crossword (the time is given in seconds).'
b'Adilbek is a true crossword expert, but, unfortunately, he is sometimes unlucky in choosing the way to solve the crossword. So, it takes him either titi seconds or ti+1ti+1 seconds to solve the ii-th crossword, equiprobably (with probability 1212 he solves the crossword in exactly titi seconds, and with probability 1212 he has to spend an additional second to finish the crossword). All these events are independent.'
b'After TT seconds pass (or after solving the last crossword, if he manages to do it in less than TT seconds), Adilbek closes the app (if he finishes some crossword at the same moment, that crossword is considered solved; otherwise Adilbek does not finish solving the current crossword at all). He thinks it would be an interesting probability theory problem to calculate EE \xe2\x80\x94 the expected number of crosswords he will be able to solve completely. Can you calculate it? '
b'Recall that the expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values \xe2\x80\x94 in this problem it means that the expected value of the number of solved crosswords can be calculated as E=\xe2\x88\x91i=0nipiE=\xe2\x88\x91i=0nipi, where pipi is the probability that Adilbek will solve exactly ii crosswords. '
b'We can represent EE as rational fraction PQPQ with Q>0Q>0. To give the answer, you should print P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7)P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x8510141\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851014) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of crosswords and the time Adilbek has to spend, respectively.'
b'The second line contains nn integers t1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tnt1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4109), where titi is the time it takes a crossword expert to solve the ii-th crossword.'
b'Note that Adilbek solves the crosswords in the order they are given in the input without skipping any of them.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the expected value of the number of crosswords Adilbek solves in TT seconds, expressed in the form of P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7)P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921mod(109+7).'
