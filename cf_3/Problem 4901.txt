b'The first line contains two integers n and k (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100000,\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891016) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pupils and days during which they will exchange books.'
b'The second line contains n different integers ai (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n), where ai is equal to the number of the pupil who has the best friend with the number i.'
b'It is guaranteed that no pupil is the best friend of himself.'
