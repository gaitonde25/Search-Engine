b'This problem is same as the next one, but has smaller constraints.'
b'Aki is playing a new video game. In the video game, he will control Neko, the giant cat, to fly between planets in the Catniverse.'
b'There are nn planets in the Catniverse, numbered from 11 to nn. At the beginning of the game, Aki chooses the planet where Neko is initially located. Then Aki performs k\xe2\x88\x921k\xe2\x88\x921 moves, where in each move Neko is moved from the current planet xx to some other planet yy such that:'
b'  Planet yy is not visited yet.  1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4x+m1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4x+m (where mm is a fixed constant given in the input) '
b'This way, Neko will visit exactly kk different planets. Two ways of visiting planets are called different if there is some index ii such that the ii-th planet visited in the first way is different from the ii-th planet visited in the second way.'
b'What is the total number of ways to visit kk planets this way? Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains three integers nn, kk and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4min(n,12)1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4min(n,12), 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa441\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa44)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of planets in the Catniverse, the number of planets Neko needs to visit and the said constant mm.'
b'Output'
b'Print exactly one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of different ways Neko can visit exactly kk planets. Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.'
