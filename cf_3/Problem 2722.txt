b'Consider several locations in integer points on the plane. One of the locations is the base where workers wait. Every other location contains one job.'
b'Each job has the following characteristics: work duration, the required number of workers, and also the earliest possible moment of starting the job and the latest possible moment of completing it. In order to complete the job, the required number of workers must simultaneously start working on it, and then be continuously present at the location for the duration of the job. Each job must either be fully done exactly once, or left untouched.'
b'Our task is to determine what should the workers do so that we have more profit. any worker can contribute to any job. We can use as many workers as we like, but each worker must take part in doing at least one job.'
b'Each worker starts at the base at a certain moment, then moves between locations and does the jobs, and finally gets back to the base and stops completely. A worker can move along coordinate axes, and spends one minute increasing or decreasing any one of his coordinates by 11. We have to pay the worker 240240 credits for appearing in our solution, and additionally 11 credit per minute, up to the moment when the worker stops completely.'
b"We get rewarded for each job that is done. For a job with duration dd and the required number of workers pp, we get a reward of d\xe2\x8b\x85p\xe2\x8b\x85(p+5)d\xe2\x8b\x85p\xe2\x8b\x85(p+5) credits. The jobs which are not done don't contribute to this sum."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer nn from 500500 to 20002000: the number of locations. Each of the following nn lines contains six integers and describes one location in the format xx\xc2\xa0yy\xc2\xa0dd\xc2\xa0pp\xc2\xa0ll\xc2\xa0hh. The coordinates xx and yy are integers from 00 to 100100. The duration dd is an integer from 55 to 3030 minutes. The required number of workers pp is an integer from 11 to 77 people. The earliest possible start moment ll and the latest possible completion moment hh are integers from 200200 to 800800 minutes, chosen so that 60\xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x88\x92l\xe2\x89\xa430060\xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x88\x92l\xe2\x89\xa4300.'
b'The first location is the base. It is an exclusion to the rules above and has the format xx\xc2\xa0yy\xc2\xa000\xc2\xa000\xc2\xa000\xc2\xa000. All given points (x,y)(x,y) are distinct.'
b'In all tests, the number nn, as well as all points, durations, numbers of required workers, and time spans are chosen randomly, independently, and uniformly from the available choices.'
b'Output'
b'Print instructions for each worker as a block of a few lines which look as follows:'
b'  start\xc2\xa0(at-moment)\xc2\xa0(at-location)The first line of a block. Determines the moment when the worker starts at the base. The location must be the base, and so have the number 11.  arrive\xc2\xa0(at-moment)\xc2\xa0(at-location)We want the worker to arrive at this moment to this location. If he can not make it in time after the previous command, the solution is considered incorrect. Locations are numbered from 11 to nn in input order.  work\xc2\xa0(start-moment)\xc2\xa0(end-moment)\xc2\xa0(at-location)We want the worker to do the job at this location in this exact time interval. The location must be equal to the location in the previous arrival command. If the worker can not make it in time after the previous command, or the given time interval has wrong length or exceeds the time span of the location, the solution is considered incorrect. This command must be present at least once in each block. Recall that each job must be either completed simultaneously by the required number of workers, or left untouched, otherwise, the solution will be considered incorrect.  endThe last line of a block. The worker must be in the same position where he started. '
b'At each moment, there may be arbitrarily many workers in each location. All moments in the output must be integers from 00 to 10001000, and all location numbers must be integers from 11 to nn.'
b'Print consecutive blocks one under the other, with no gaps.'

b'The job at location 44 is not completed.'
b'We have to pay 240+71=311240+71=311 credits to the first worker.'
b'We also have to pay 240+40=280240+40=280 credits to the second worker.'
b'Profit: 420+174\xe2\x88\x92311\xe2\x88\x92280=3420+174\xe2\x88\x92311\xe2\x88\x92280=3.'
b'Note that this example is too short (n<500n<500) and so does not appear in the testing system. It is included for explanatory purposes only.'
b'Scoring'
b'Each test is scored independently. The score for a test is the profit divided by 10001000. It the profit is negative, the score is equal to zero. If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is also zero.'
b'Testing'
b"Your solution will be checked on sets of tests generated in advance. A solution's score is the sum of its results on all the tests. If a solution did not output a valid answer on a certain test, the result for this test is zero."
b'During the main phase of the contest, there are two ways to submit a solution.'
b'  The first one, problem A1, is to check on examples. There are 1010 example tests which are also available for local testing. As soon as the solution is checked, you can see reports for all examples by clicking on the submission result. The tests for A1 are open, you can download them from the links https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1160/codeforces-vrt-2019.tar.gz (for Linux) and https://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1160/codeforces-vrt-2019.zip (for Windows). After testing, you can click the verdict of your submission to see the result for each test.  The second way, problem A2, is to check on preliminary tests. There are 100100 preliminary tests which are generated in advance but kept secret. The score for preliminary tests (but not for example tests) is used in the preliminary scoreboard. This score does not affect the final results, but nevertheless allows to roughly compare a solution with others. '
b'After the main phase ends, for each participant, the system chooses the final solution:'
b'  consider all solutions sent for preliminary testing;  choose the ones which got a total score strictly greater than zero;  define the final solution as the one of chosen solutions which has the latest submission time. '
b'Note that the solutions sent only to be checked on examples are not considered when choosing the final solution.'
b'During final testing, all final solutions will be checked on the same set of a large number (\xe2\x89\x881000\xe2\x89\x881000) of final tests. The score for final tests determines the final scoreboard. The winner is the contestant whose solution gets the highest total score. In case two or more participants have equal total score, the contestants with such score tie for the same place.'
