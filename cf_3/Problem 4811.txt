b'Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.'
b'You are given q queries and a multiset A, initially containing only integer 0. There are three types of queries:'
b'  "+ x"\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 add integer x to multiset A. "- x"\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 erase one occurrence of integer x from multiset A. It\'s guaranteed that at least one x is present in the multiset A before this query. "? x"\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 you are given integer x and need to compute the value , i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer x and some integer y from the multiset A.'
b'Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer q (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89q\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89200\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.'
b"Each of the following q lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer xi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89xi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type."
b'Note, that the integer 0 will always be present in the set A.'
b'Output'
b"For each query of the type '?' print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer xi and some integer from the multiset A."
