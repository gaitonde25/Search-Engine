b'This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543'
b'You are given a directed acyclic graph GG with nn vertices and mm edges. Denote by R(v)R(v) the set of all vertices uu reachable from vv by moving along the edges of GG. Find \xe2\x88\x91v=1n|R(v)|2\xe2\x88\x91v=1n|R(v)|2.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n,mn,m (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104) denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges of GG.'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two integers u,vu,v (1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa0v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa0v\xe2\x89\xa4n), denoting the edge from uu to vv. '
b"It's guaranteed that the given graph does not contain any cycles."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the problem.'
