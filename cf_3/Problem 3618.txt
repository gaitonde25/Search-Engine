b'SaMer has written the greatest test case of all time for one of his problems. For a given array of integers, the problem asks to find the minimum number of groups the array can be divided into, such that the product of any pair of integers in the same group is a perfect square. '
b'Each integer must be in exactly one group. However, integers in a group do not necessarily have to be contiguous in the array.'
b'SaMer wishes to create more cases from the test case he already has. His test case has an array AA of nn integers, and he needs to find the number of contiguous subarrays of AA that have an answer to the problem equal to kk for each integer kk between 11 and nn (inclusive).'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000), the size of the array.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1a1,a2a2,\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6,anan (\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4108\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4108), the values of the array.'
b'Output'
b'Output nn space-separated integers, the kk-th integer should be the number of contiguous subarrays of AA that have an answer to the problem equal to kk.'
