b'You and your friend Ilya are participating in an individual programming contest consisting of multiple stages. A contestant can get between 00 and 100100 points, inclusive, for each stage, independently of other contestants.'
b'Points received by contestants in different stages are used for forming overall contest results. Suppose that kk stages of the contest are completed. For each contestant, k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x8c\x8ak4\xe2\x8c\x8bk\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x8c\x8ak4\xe2\x8c\x8b stages with the highest scores are selected, and these scores are added up. This sum is the overall result of the contestant. (Here \xe2\x8c\x8at\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8at\xe2\x8c\x8b denotes rounding tt down.)'
b'For example, suppose 99 stages are completed, and your scores are 50,30,50,50,100,10,30,100,5050,30,50,50,100,10,30,100,50. First, 77 stages with the highest scores are chosen\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 for example, all stages except for the 22-nd and the 66-th can be chosen. Then your overall result is equal to 50+50+50+100+30+100+50=43050+50+50+100+30+100+50=430.'
b"As of now, nn stages are completed, and you know the points you and Ilya got for these stages. However, it is unknown how many more stages will be held. You wonder what the smallest number of additional stages is, after which your result might become greater than or equal to Ilya's result, at least in theory. Find this number!"
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of completed stages.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 your points for the completed stages.'
b"The third line contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Ilya's points for the completed stages."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the smallest number of additional stages required for your result to be able to become greater than or equal to Ilya's result."
b"If your result is already not less than Ilya's result, print 00."
