Vasiliy can switch subjects while preparing for exams, it is not necessary to prepare continuously during ai days for the exam number i. He can mix the order of preparation for exams in any way.'
b'Your task is to determine the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams, or determine that it is impossible. Each exam should be passed exactly one time. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of days in the exam period and the number of subjects. '
b'The second line contains n integers d1,\xe2\x80\x89d2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89dn (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89di\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m), where di is the number of subject, the exam of which can be passed on the day number i. If di equals 0, it is not allowed to pass any exams on the day number i. '
b'The third line contains m positive integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89am (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105), where ai is the number of days that are needed to prepare before passing the exam on the subject i.'

b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams. If it is impossible, print -1.'
