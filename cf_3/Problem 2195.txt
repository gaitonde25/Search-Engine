b'An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 11. More formally, a sequence s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn is beautiful if |si\xe2\x88\x92si+1|=1|si\xe2\x88\x92si+1|=1 for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Trans has aa numbers 00, bb numbers 11, cc numbers 22 and dd numbers 33. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a+b+c+da+b+c+d numbers.'
b'However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?'
b'Input'
b'The only input line contains four non-negative integers aa, bb, cc and dd (0<a+b+c+d\xe2\x89\xa41050<a+b+c+d\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.'
b'Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a+b+c+da+b+c+d integers, separated by spaces\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a beautiful sequence. There should be aa numbers equal to 00, bb numbers equal to 11, cc numbers equal to 22 and dd numbers equal to 33.'
b'If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.'
