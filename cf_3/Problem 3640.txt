b'You are given a bipartite graph G\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89(U,\xe2\x80\x89V,\xe2\x80\x89E), U is the set of vertices of the first part, V is the set of vertices of the second part and E is the set of edges. There might be multiple edges.'
b"Let's call some subset of its edges  k-covering iff the graph  has each of its vertices incident to at least k edges. Minimal k-covering is such a k-covering that the size of the subset  is minimal possible."
b'Your task is to find minimal k-covering for each , where minDegree is the minimal degree of any vertex in graph G.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers n1, n2 and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n1,\xe2\x80\x89n2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892000, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the first part, the number of vertices in the second part and the number of edges, respectively.'
b'The i-th of the next m lines contain two integers ui and vi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ui\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n1,\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89vi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n2) \xe2\x80\x94 the description of the i-th edge, ui is the index of the vertex in the first part and vi is the index of the vertex in the second part.'
b'Output'
b'For each  print the subset of edges (minimal k-covering) in separate line.'
b'The first integer cntk of the k-th line is the number of edges in minimal k-covering of the graph. Then cntk integers follow \xe2\x80\x94 original indices of the edges which belong to the minimal k-covering, these indices should be pairwise distinct. Edges are numbered 1 through m in order they are given in the input.'
