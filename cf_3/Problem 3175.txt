b'Polycarp is working on a new operating system called BerOS. He asks you to help with implementation of a file suggestion feature.'
b'There are nn files on hard drive and their names are f1,f2,\xe2\x80\xa6,fnf1,f2,\xe2\x80\xa6,fn. Any file name contains between 11 and 88 characters, inclusive. All file names are unique.'
b'The file suggestion feature handles queries, each represented by a string ss. For each query ss it should count number of files containing ss as a substring (i.e. some continuous segment of characters in a file name equals ss) and suggest any such file name.'
b'For example, if file names are "read.me", "hosts", "ops", and "beros.18", and the query is "os", the number of matched files is 22 (two file names contain "os" as a substring) and suggested file name can be either "hosts" or "beros.18".'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xe2\x80\x94 the total number of files.'
b'The following nn lines contain file names, one per line. The ii-th line contains fifi \xe2\x80\x94 the name of the ii-th file. Each file name contains between 11 and 88 characters, inclusive. File names contain only lowercase Latin letters, digits and dot characters (\'.\'). Any sequence of valid characters can be a file name (for example, in BerOS ".", ".." and "..." are valid file names). All file names are unique.'
b'The following line contains integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4500001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa450000) \xe2\x80\x94 the total number of queries.'
b"The following qq lines contain queries s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sqs1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sq, one per line. Each sjsj has length between 11 and 88 characters, inclusive. It contains only lowercase Latin letters, digits and dot characters ('.')."
b'Output'
b'Print qq lines, one per query. The jj-th line should contain the response on the jj-th query \xe2\x80\x94 two values cjcj and tjtj, where'
b"  cjcj is the number of matched files for the jj-th query,  tjtj is the name of any file matched by the jj-th query. If there is no such file, print a single character '-' instead. If there are multiple matched files, print any. "
