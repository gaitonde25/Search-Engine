b"Suppose you are stuck on a desert island. The only way to save yourself is to craft a wooden raft and go to the sea. Fortunately, you have a hand-made saw and a forest nearby. Moreover, you've already cut several trees and prepared it to the point that now you have nn logs and the ii-th log has length aiai."
b"The wooden raft you'd like to build has the following structure: 22 logs of length xx and xx logs of length yy. Such raft would have the area equal to x\xe2\x8b\x85yx\xe2\x8b\x85y. Both xx and yy must be integers since it's the only way you can measure the lengths while being on a desert island. And both xx and yy must be at least 22 since the raft that is one log wide is unstable."
b"You can cut logs in pieces but you can't merge two logs in one. What is the maximum area of the raft you can craft?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the only integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of logs you have.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (2\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the corresponding lengths of the logs.'
b"It's guaranteed that you can always craft at least 2\xc3\x9722\xc3\x972 raft."
b'Output'
b'Print the only integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum area of the raft you can craft.'
