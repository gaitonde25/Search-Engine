You can pour your glass by exactly 11 liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by ss liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.'
b"Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by ss liters of kvass."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4103, 1\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa410121\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa41012)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of kegs and glass volume.'
