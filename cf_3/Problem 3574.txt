b'You are given an integer nn from 11 to 10181018 without leading zeroes.'
b'In one move you can swap any two adjacent digits in the given number in such a way that the resulting number will not contain leading zeroes. In other words, after each move the number you have cannot contain any leading zeroes.'
b'What is the minimum number of moves you have to make to obtain a number that is divisible by 2525? Print -1 if it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 2525.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41018). It is guaranteed that the first (left) digit of the number nn is not a zero.'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 2525, print -1. Otherwise print the minimum number of moves required to obtain such number.'
b'Note that you can swap only adjacent digits in the given number.'
