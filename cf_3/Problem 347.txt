b'Vlad has nn friends, for each of whom he wants to buy one gift for the New Year.'
b'There are mm shops in the city, in each of which he can buy a gift for any of his friends. If the jj-th friend (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4n) receives a gift bought in the shop with the number ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4m), then the friend receives pijpij units of joy. The rectangular table pijpij is given in the input.'
b'Vlad has time to visit at most n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 shops (where nn is the number of friends). He chooses which shops he will visit and for which friends he will buy gifts in each of them.'
b"Let the jj-th friend receive ajaj units of joy from Vlad's gift. Let's find the value \xce\xb1=min{a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an}\xce\xb1=min{a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an}. Vlad's goal is to buy gifts so that the value of \xce\xb1\xce\xb1 is as large as possible. In other words, Vlad wants to maximize the minimum of the joys of his friends."
b'For example, let m=2m=2, n=2n=2. Let the joy from the gifts that we can buy in the first shop: p11=1p11=1, p12=2p12=2, in the second shop: p21=3p21=3, p22=4p22=4.'
b'Then it is enough for Vlad to go only to the second shop and buy a gift for the first friend, bringing joy 33, and for the second\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 bringing joy 44. In this case, the value \xce\xb1\xce\xb1 will be equal to min{3,4}=3min{3,4}=3'
b'Help Vlad choose gifts for his friends so that the value of \xce\xb1\xce\xb1 is as high as possible. Please note that each friend must receive one gift. Vlad can visit at most n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 shops (where nn is the number of friends). In the shop, he can buy any number of gifts.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input.'
b'An empty line is written before each test case. Then there is a line containing integers mm and nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n2\xe2\x89\xa4n, 2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x8b\x85m\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x8b\x85m\xe2\x89\xa4105) separated by a space\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of shops and the number of friends, where n\xe2\x8b\x85mn\xe2\x8b\x85m is the product of nn and mm.'
b'Then mm lines follow, each containing nn numbers. The number in the ii-th row of the jj-th column pijpij (1\xe2\x89\xa4pij\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4pij\xe2\x89\xa4109) is the joy of the product intended for friend number jj in shop number ii.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n\xe2\x8b\x85mn\xe2\x8b\x85m over all test cases in the test does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b"Print tt lines, each line must contain the answer to the corresponding test case\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible value of \xce\xb1\xce\xb1, where \xce\xb1\xce\xb1 is the minimum of the joys from a gift for all of Vlad's friends."
