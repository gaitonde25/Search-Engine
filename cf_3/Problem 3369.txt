b'Vasya owns a cornfield which can be defined with two integers nn and dd. The cornfield can be represented as rectangle with vertices having Cartesian coordinates (0,d),(d,0),(n,n\xe2\x88\x92d)(0,d),(d,0),(n,n\xe2\x88\x92d) and (n\xe2\x88\x92d,n)(n\xe2\x88\x92d,n).'
b'  An example of a cornfield with n=7n=7 and d=2d=2. '
b'Vasya also knows that there are mm grasshoppers near the field (maybe even inside it). The ii-th grasshopper is at the point (xi,yi)(xi,yi). Vasya does not like when grasshoppers eat his corn, so for each grasshopper he wants to know whether its position is inside the cornfield (including the border) or outside.'
b'Help Vasya! For each grasshopper determine if it is inside the field (including the border).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and dd (1\xe2\x89\xa4d<n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4d<n\xe2\x89\xa4100).'
b'The second line contains a single integer mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of grasshoppers.'
b'The ii-th of the next mm lines contains two integers xixi and yiyi (0\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 position of the ii-th grasshopper.'
b'Output'
b'Print mm lines. The ii-th line should contain "YES" if the position of the ii-th grasshopper lies inside or on the border of the cornfield. Otherwise the ii-th line should contain "NO".'
b'You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
