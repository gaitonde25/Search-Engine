b'You are given a string ss consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Let the length of ss be |s||s|. You may perform several operations on this string.'
b'In one operation, you can choose some index ii and remove the ii-th character of ss (sisi) if at least one of its adjacent characters is the previous letter in the Latin alphabet for sisi. For example, the previous letter for b is a, the previous letter for s is r, the letter a has no previous letters. Note that after each removal the length of the string decreases by one. So, the index ii should satisfy the condition 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|s|1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4|s| during each operation.'
b'For the character sisi adjacent characters are si\xe2\x88\x921si\xe2\x88\x921 and si+1si+1. The first and the last characters of ss both have only one adjacent character (unless |s|=1|s|=1).'
b'Consider the following example. Let s=s= bacabcab.'
b"  During the first move, you can remove the first character s1=s1= b because s2=s2= a. Then the string becomes s=s= acabcab.  During the second move, you can remove the fifth character s5=s5= c because s4=s4= b. Then the string becomes s=s= acabab.  During the third move, you can remove the sixth character s6=s6='b' because s5=s5= a. Then the string becomes s=s= acaba.  During the fourth move, the only character you can remove is s4=s4= b, because s3=s3= a (or s5=s5= a). The string becomes s=s= acaa and you cannot do anything with it. "
b'Your task is to find the maximum possible number of characters you can remove if you choose the sequence of operations optimally.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer |s||s| (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of ss.'
b'The second line of the input contains one string ss consisting of |s||s| lowercase Latin letters.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible number of characters you can remove if you choose the sequence of moves optimally.'
