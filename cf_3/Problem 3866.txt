b"Imagine that Alice is playing a card game with her friend Bob. They both have exactly 88 cards and there is an integer on each card, ranging from 00 to 44. In each round, Alice or Bob in turns choose two cards from different players, let them be aa and bb, where aa is the number on the player's card, and bb is the number on the opponent's card. It is necessary that a\xe2\x8b\x85b\xe2\x89\xa00a\xe2\x8b\x85b\xe2\x89\xa00. Then they calculate c=(a+b)mod5c=(a+b)mod5 and replace the number aa with cc. The player who ends up with numbers on all 88 cards being 00, wins."
b"Now Alice wants to know who wins in some situations. She will give you her cards' numbers, Bob's cards' numbers and the person playing the first round. Your task is to determine who wins if both of them choose the best operation in their rounds."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one positive integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100000), denoting the number of situations you need to consider.'
b'The following lines describe those TT situations. For each situation:'
b"  The first line contains a non-negative integer ff (0\xe2\x89\xa4f\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x89\xa4f\xe2\x89\xa41), where f=0f=0 means that Alice plays first and f=1f=1 means Bob plays first.  The second line contains 88 non-negative integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a8a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a8 (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa440\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa44), describing Alice's cards.  The third line contains 88 non-negative integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,b8b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,b8 (0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa440\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa44), describing Bob's cards. "
b'We guarantee that if f=0f=0, we have \xe2\x88\x918i=1ai\xe2\x89\xa00\xe2\x88\x91i=18ai\xe2\x89\xa00. Also when f=1f=1, \xe2\x88\x918i=1bi\xe2\x89\xa00\xe2\x88\x91i=18bi\xe2\x89\xa00 holds.'
b'Output'
b'Output TT lines. For each situation, determine who wins. Output '
b'  "Alice" (without quotes) if Alice wins.  "Bob" (without quotes) if Bob wins.  "Deal" (without quotes) if it gets into a deal, i.e. no one wins. '
