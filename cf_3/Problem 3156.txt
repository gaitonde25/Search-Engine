b"You are given an undirected connected weighted graph consisting of nn vertices and mm edges. Let's denote the length of the shortest path from vertex 11 to vertex ii as didi. "
b"You have to erase some edges of the graph so that at most kk edges remain. Let's call a vertex ii good if there still exists a path from 11 to ii with length didi after erasing the edges."
b'Your goal is to erase the edges in such a way that the number of good vertices is maximized.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, mm and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105, n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4mn\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m, 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4m0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4m) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the maximum number of edges that can be retained in the graph, respectively.'
b'Then mm lines follow, each containing three integers xx, yy, ww (1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n, x\xe2\x89\xa0yx\xe2\x89\xa0y, 1\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa4109), denoting an edge connecting vertices xx and yy and having weight ww.'
b'The given graph is connected (any vertex can be reached from any other vertex) and simple (there are no self-loops, and for each unordered pair of vertices there exists at most one edge connecting these vertices).'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print ee \xe2\x80\x94 the number of edges that should remain in the graph (0\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa4k0\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa4k).'
b'In the second line print ee distinct integers from 11 to mm \xe2\x80\x94 the indices of edges that should remain in the graph. Edges are numbered in the same order they are given in the input. The number of good vertices should be as large as possible.'
