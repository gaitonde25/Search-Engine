b'Dima has a hamsters farm. Soon N hamsters will grow up on it and Dima will sell them in a city nearby.'
b"Hamsters should be transported in boxes. If some box is not completely full, the hamsters in it are bored, that's why each box should be completely full with hamsters."
b'Dima can buy boxes at a factory. The factory produces boxes of K kinds, boxes of the i-th kind can contain in themselves ai hamsters. Dima can buy any amount of boxes, but he should buy boxes of only one kind to get a wholesale discount.'

b'Find out how many boxes and of which type should Dima buy to transport maximum number of hamsters.'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains two integers N and K (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89N\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891018, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89K\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of hamsters that will grow up on Dima's farm and the number of types of boxes that the factory produces."
b'The second line contains K integers a1, a2, ..., aK (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891018 for all i)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the capacities of boxes.'
b'Output'
