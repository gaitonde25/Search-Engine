b'Allen, having graduated from the MOO Institute of Techcowlogy (MIT), has started a startup! Allen is the president of his startup. He also hires n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 other employees, each of which is assigned a direct superior. If uu is a superior of vv and vv is a superior of ww then also uu is a superior of ww. Additionally, there are no uu and vv such that uu is the superior of vv and vv is the superior of uu. Allen himself has no superior. Allen is employee number 11, and the others are employee numbers 22 through nn.'
b"Finally, Allen must assign salaries to each employee in the company including himself. Due to budget constraints, each employee's salary is an integer between 11 and DD. Additionally, no employee can make strictly more than his superior."
b'Help Allen find the number of ways to assign salaries. As this number may be large, output it modulo 109+7109+7.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and DD (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa430001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The remaining n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines each contain a single positive integer, where the ii-th line contains the integer pipi (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4i1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4i). pipi denotes the direct superior of employee i+1i+1.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer: the number of ways to assign salaries modulo 109+7109+7.'
