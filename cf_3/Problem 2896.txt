b'Little W and Little P decided to send letters to each other regarding the most important events during a day. There are nn events during a day: at time moment titi something happens to the person pipi (pipi is either W or P, denoting Little W and Little P, respectively), so he needs to immediately send a letter to the other person. They can send a letter using one of the two ways:'
b"  Ask Friendly O to deliver the letter directly. Friendly O takes dd acorns for each letter. Leave the letter at Wise R's den. Wise R values free space, so he takes c\xe2\x8b\x85Tc\xe2\x8b\x85T acorns for storing a letter for a time segment of length TT. The recipient can take a letter from Wise R either when he leaves his own letter at Wise R's den, or at time moment tn+1tn+1, when everybody comes to Wise R for a tea. It is not possible to take a letter from Wise R's den at other time moments. The friends can store as many letters at Wise R's den as they want, paying for each one separately. "
b'Help the friends determine the minimum possible total cost of sending all letters.'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains three integers n,c,dn,c,d (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa41021\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4102, 1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4108)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of letters, the cost of storing a letter for one time unit at Wise R's den and the cost of delivering a letter via Friendly O."
b'The next nn describe the events. The ii-th of them contains an integer titi and a character pipi (0\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4106, pipi is either W or P)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the time the ii-th event happens and the person the event happens to.'
b'The last line contains a single integer tn+1tn+1 (0\xe2\x89\xa4tn+1\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4tn+1\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the time when everybody comes to Wise R for a tea and takes all remaining letters. '
