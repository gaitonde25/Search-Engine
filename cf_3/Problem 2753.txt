b'There are nn shovels in the nearby shop. The ii-th shovel costs aiai bourles.'
b'Misha has to buy exactly kk shovels. Each shovel can be bought no more than once.'
b'Misha can buy shovels by several purchases. During one purchase he can choose any subset of remaining (non-bought) shovels and buy this subset.'
b'There are also mm special offers in the shop. The jj-th of them is given as a pair (xj,yj)(xj,yj), and it means that if Misha buys exactly xjxj shovels during one purchase then yjyj most cheapest of them are for free (i.e. he will not pay for yjyj most cheapest shovels during the current purchase).'
b'Misha can use any offer any (possibly, zero) number of times, but he cannot use more than one offer during one purchase (but he can buy shovels without using any offers).'
b'Your task is to calculate the minimum cost of buying kk shovels, if Misha buys them optimally.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains three integers n,mn,m and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4min(n,2000)1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4min(n,2000)) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of shovels in the shop, the number of special offers and the number of shovels Misha has to buy, correspondingly.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105), where aiai is the cost of the ii-th shovel.'
b'The next mm lines contain special offers. The jj-th of them is given as a pair of integers (xi,yi)(xi,yi) (1\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4n) and means that if Misha buys exactly xixi shovels during some purchase, then he can take yiyi most cheapest of them for free.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum cost of buying kk shovels if Misha buys them optimally.'
