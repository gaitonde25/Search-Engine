b'Ksenia has an array aa consisting of nn positive integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. '
b'In one operation she can do the following: '
b'  choose three distinct indices ii, jj, kk, and then  change all of ai,aj,akai,aj,ak to ai\xe2\x8a\x95aj\xe2\x8a\x95akai\xe2\x8a\x95aj\xe2\x8a\x95ak simultaneously, where \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation. '
b"She wants to make all aiai equal in at most nn operations, or to determine that it is impossible to do so. She wouldn't ask for your help, but please, help her!"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of aa.'
b'The second line contains nn integers, a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 elements of aa.'
b'Output'
b'Print YES or NO in the first line depending on whether it is possible to make all elements equal in at most nn operations.'
b'If it is possible, print an integer mm (0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n), which denotes the number of operations you do.'
b'In each of the next mm lines, print three distinct integers i,j,ki,j,k, representing one operation. '
b'If there are many such operation sequences possible, print any. Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.'
