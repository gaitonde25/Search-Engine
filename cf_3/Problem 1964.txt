b'VK news recommendation system daily selects interesting publications of one of nn disjoint categories for each user. Each publication belongs to exactly one category. For each category ii batch algorithm selects aiai publications.'
b'The latest A/B test suggests that users are reading recommended publications more actively if each category has a different number of publications within daily recommendations. The targeted algorithm can find a single interesting publication of ii-th category within titi seconds. '
b"What is the minimum total time necessary to add publications to the result of batch algorithm execution, so all categories have a different number of publications? You can't remove publications recommended by the batch algorithm."
b'Input'
b'The first line of input consists of single integer nn\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of news categories (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000).'
b'The second line of input consists of nn integers aiai\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of publications of ii-th category selected by the batch algorithm (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The third line of input consists of nn integers titi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 time it takes for targeted algorithm to find one new publication of category ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4105)1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimal required time for the targeted algorithm to get rid of categories with the same size.'
