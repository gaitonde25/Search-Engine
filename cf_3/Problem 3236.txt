b'Vasya has recently got a job as a cashier at a local store. His day at work is LL minutes long. Vasya has already memorized nn regular customers, the ii-th of which comes after titi minutes after the beginning of the day, and his service consumes lili minutes.

b'Vasya is a bit lazy, so he likes taking smoke breaks for aa minutes each. Those breaks may go one after another, but Vasya must be present at work during all the time periods he must serve regular customers, otherwise one of them may alert his boss. What is the maximum number of breaks Vasya can take during the day?'
