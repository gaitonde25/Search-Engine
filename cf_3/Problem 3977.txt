b'Lakhesh loves to make movies, so Nephren helps her run a cinema. We may call it No. 68 Cinema.'
b''
b"However, one day, the No. 68 Cinema runs out of changes (they don't have 50-yuan notes currently), but Nephren still wants to start their business. (Assume that yuan is a kind of currency in Regulu Ere.)"
b"There are three types of customers: some of them bring exactly a 50-yuan note; some of them bring a 100-yuan note and Nephren needs to give a 50-yuan note back to him/her; some of them bring VIP cards so that they don't need to pay for the ticket."
b'Now n customers are waiting outside in queue. Nephren wants to know how many possible queues are there that they are able to run smoothly (i.e. every customer can receive his/her change), and that the number of 50-yuan notes they have after selling tickets to all these customers is between l and r, inclusive. Two queues are considered different if there exists a customer whose type is different in two queues. As the number can be large, please output the answer modulo p.'
