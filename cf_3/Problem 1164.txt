b'Consider a long corridor which can be divided into nn square cells of size 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971. These cells are numbered from 11 to nn from left to right.'
b'There are two people in this corridor, a hooligan and a security guard. Initially, the hooligan is in the aa-th cell, the guard is in the bb-th cell (a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b). '
b'  One of the possible situations. The corridor consists of 77 cells, the hooligan is in the 33-rd cell, the guard is in the 66-th (n=7n=7, a=3a=3, b=6b=6). '
b"There are mm firecrackers in the hooligan's pocket, the ii-th firecracker explodes in sisi seconds after being lit."
b'The following events happen each second (sequentially, exactly in the following order):'
b"  firstly, the hooligan either moves into an adjacent cell (from the cell ii, he can move to the cell (i+1)(i+1) or to the cell (i\xe2\x88\x921)(i\xe2\x88\x921), and he cannot leave the corridor) or stays in the cell he is currently. If the hooligan doesn't move, he can light one of his firecrackers and drop it. The hooligan can't move into the cell where the guard is;  secondly, some firecrackers that were already dropped may explode. Formally, if the firecracker jj is dropped on the TT-th second, then it will explode on the (T+sj)(T+sj)-th second (for example, if a firecracker with sj=2sj=2 is dropped on the 44-th second, it explodes on the 66-th second);  finally, the guard moves one cell closer to the hooligan. If the guard moves to the cell where the hooligan is, the hooligan is caught. "
b'Obviously, the hooligan will be caught sooner or later, since the corridor is finite. His goal is to see the maximum number of firecrackers explode before he is caught; that is, he will act in order to maximize the number of firecrackers that explodes before he is caught.'
b'Your task is to calculate the number of such firecrackers, if the hooligan acts optimally.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers nn, mm, aa and bb (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109; 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; 1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n; a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the corridor, the number of firecrackers, the initial location of the hooligan and the initial location of the guard, respectively.'
b'The second line contains mm integers s1s1, s2s2, ..., smsm (1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4109), where sisi is the time it takes the ii-th firecracker to explode after it is lit.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of firecrackers that the hooligan can explode before he is caught.'
