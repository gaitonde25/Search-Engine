b'A string a=a1a2\xe2\x80\xa6ana=a1a2\xe2\x80\xa6an is called even if it consists of a concatenation (joining) of strings of length 22 consisting of the same characters. In other words, a string aa is even if two conditions are satisfied at the same time:'
b'  its length nn is even;  for all odd ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921), ai=ai+1ai=ai+1 is satisfied. '
b'For example, the following strings are even: "" (empty string), "tt", "aabb", "oooo", and "ttrrrroouuuuuuuukk". The following strings are not even: "aaa", "abab" and "abba".'
b'Given a string ss consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Find the minimum number of characters to remove from the string ss to make it even. The deleted characters do not have to be consecutive.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input data contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94the number of test cases in the test.'
b'The descriptions of the test cases follow.'
b'Each test case consists of one string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105), where |s||s|\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string ss. The string consists of lowercase Latin letters.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of |s||s| on all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of characters that must be removed to make ss even.'
