b'Polycarp is the project manager in the IT-company. Right now, he needs to choose developers for his team to start a new project. The company has nn developers "on the bench" (i.e not involved in other projects). Polycarp assessed the skills of each of them: aiai (\xe2\x88\x92104\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104\xe2\x88\x92104\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 an integer characteristic of the ii-th developer. This value can be either positive, zero or even negative (some developers cause distractions).'
b'After Polycarp chooses a subset of developers for his team, the strength of the team will be determined by the sum of aiai values for all selected developers.'
b'Polycarp fears that if he chooses a team in such a way that maximizes the sum of the characteristics of aiai, other managers may find this unacceptable. For this reason, he plans to create such a team that the sum of the aiai values for it is strictly less than the maximum possible value.'
b'Help Polycarp choose any team that:'
b'  the sum of the characteristics aiai for all members of the selected team is strictly less than the maximum value that can be achieved by choosing the team in some other way  and at the same time, the sum of the characteristics of aiai for all members of the selected team is the greatest possible. '
b'If, following the requirements above, you can select a team in several ways, then just find any of them. '
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of the characteristics in the desired subset is strictly positive (i.e. Polycarp can always choose a non-empty team)."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case begins with a line containing one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of developers "on the bench".'
b'The second line of a test case contains a sequence of integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (\xe2\x88\x92104\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104\xe2\x88\x92104\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the characteristics of the nn developers. It is guaranteed that the characteristics are such that the sum of the characteristics in the answer is strictly positive.'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases in the input doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'Print the answers for the given tt test cases in the order that they appear in the input. In the first line of each answer, print a positive integer ss \xe2\x80\x94 the sum of the characteristics in the desired subset. The second line should contain only the characters 0 and 1 and match the answer:'
b'  the character in the ii-th position should be equal to 1 if the ii-th developer belongs to the team;  the character in the ii-th position should be equal to 0 if the ii-th developer does not belong to the team. '
b'If there are several answers, print any of them.'
