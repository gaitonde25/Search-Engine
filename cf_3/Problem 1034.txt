b'There is a new attraction in Singapore Zoo: The Infinite Zoo.'
b'The Infinite Zoo can be represented by a graph with an infinite number of vertices labeled 1,2,3,\xe2\x80\xa61,2,3,\xe2\x80\xa6. There is a directed edge from vertex uu to vertex u+vu+v if and only if u&v=vu&v=v, where && denotes the bitwise AND operation. There are no other edges in the graph.'
b'Zookeeper has qq queries. In the ii-th query she will ask you if she can travel from vertex uiui to vertex vivi by going through directed edges.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'The ii-th of the next qq lines will contain two integers uiui, vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi<2301\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi<230) \xe2\x80\x94 a query made by Zookeeper.'
b'Output'
b'For the ii-th of the qq queries, output "YES" in a single line if Zookeeper can travel from vertex uiui to vertex vivi. Otherwise, output "NO".'
b'You can print your answer in any case. For example, if the answer is "YES", then the output "Yes" or "yeS" will also be considered as correct answer.'
