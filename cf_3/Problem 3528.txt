b'There are quite a lot of ways to have fun with inflatable balloons. For example, you can fill them with water and see what happens.'
b'Grigory and Andrew have the same opinion. So, once upon a time, they went to the shop and bought nn packets with inflatable balloons, where ii-th of them has exactly aiai balloons inside.'
b'They want to divide the balloons among themselves. In addition, there are several conditions to hold:'
b"  Do not rip the packets (both Grigory and Andrew should get unbroken packets);  Distribute all packets (every packet should be given to someone);  Give both Grigory and Andrew at least one packet;  To provide more fun, the total number of balloons in Grigory's packets should not be equal to the total number of balloons in Andrew's packets. "
b"Help them to divide the balloons or determine that it's impossible under these conditions."
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of packets with balloons.'
b'The second line contains nn integers: a1a1, a2a2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of balloons inside the corresponding packet.'
b'Output'
b"If it's impossible to divide the balloons satisfying the conditions above, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921."
b"Otherwise, print an integer kk\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of packets to give to Grigory followed by kk distinct integers from 11 to nn\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the indices of those. The order of packets doesn't matter."
b'If there are multiple ways to divide balloons, output any of them.'
