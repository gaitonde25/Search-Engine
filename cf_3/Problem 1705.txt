b"You might have remembered Theatre square from the problem 1A. Now it's finally getting repaved."
b'The square still has a rectangular shape of n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m meters. However, the picture is about to get more complicated now. Let ai,jai,j be the jj-th square in the ii-th row of the pavement.'
b'You are given the picture of the squares:'
b'  if ai,j=ai,j= "*", then the jj-th square in the ii-th row should be black;  if ai,j=ai,j= ".", then the jj-th square in the ii-th row should be white. '
b'The black squares are paved already. You have to pave the white squares. There are two options for pavement tiles:'
b'  1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 tiles\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 each tile costs xx burles and covers exactly 11 square;  1\xc3\x9721\xc3\x972 tiles\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 each tile costs yy burles and covers exactly 22 adjacent squares of the same row. Note that you are not allowed to rotate these tiles or cut them into 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 tiles. '
b'You should cover all the white squares, no two tiles should overlap and no black squares should be covered by tiles.'
b'What is the smallest total price of the tiles needed to cover all the white squares?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4500)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases. Then the description of tt testcases follow.'
b'The first line of each testcase contains four integers nn, mm, xx and yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100; 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41000; 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of the Theatre square, the price of the 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 tile and the price of the 1\xc3\x9721\xc3\x972 tile.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains mm characters. The jj-th character in the ii-th line is ai,jai,j. If ai,j=ai,j= "*", then the jj-th square in the ii-th row should be black, and if ai,j=ai,j= ".", then the jj-th square in the ii-th row should be white.'
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m over all testcases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the smallest total price of the tiles needed to cover all the white squares in burles.'
