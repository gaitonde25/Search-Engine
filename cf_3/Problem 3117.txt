b'The Fair Nut lives in nn story house. aiai people live on the ii-th floor of the house. Every person uses elevator twice a day: to get from the floor where he/she lives to the ground (first) floor and to get from the first floor to the floor where he/she lives, when he/she comes back home in the evening. '
b"It was decided that elevator, when it is not used, will stay on the xx-th floor, but xx hasn't been chosen yet. When a person needs to get from floor aa to floor bb, elevator follows the simple algorithm: "
b'  Moves from the xx-th floor (initially it stays on the xx-th floor) to the aa-th and takes the passenger.  Moves from the aa-th floor to the bb-th floor and lets out the passenger (if aa equals bb, elevator just opens and closes the doors, but still comes to the floor from the xx-th floor).  Moves from the bb-th floor back to the xx-th. '
b' The elevator never transposes more than one person and always goes back to the floor '
b''
b'xx'
b'x'
b' before transposing a next passenger. The elevator spends one unit of electricity to move between neighboring floors. So moving from the '

b'aa'
b'a'
b'-th floor to the '

b'bb'
b'b'
b'-th floor requires '
b''
b'|a\xe2\x88\x92b||a\xe2\x88\x92b|'
b'|a - b|'
b' units of electricity.'
b"Your task is to help Nut to find the minimum number of electricity units, that it would be enough for one day, by choosing an optimal the xx-th floor. Don't forget than elevator initially stays on the xx-th floor. "
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of floors.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of people on each floor.'
b'Output'
b'In a single line, print the answer to the problem\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of electricity units.'
