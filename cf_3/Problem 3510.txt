b'You are given a qubit which is guaranteed to be either in  or in  state. '
b'Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 1 if it was a  state or -1 if it was  state. The state of the qubit after the operations does not matter.'
b'Input'
b'You have to implement an operation which takes a qubit as an input and returns an integer. '
b'Your code should have the following signature:'
b'namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (q : Qubit) : Int    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }}'
