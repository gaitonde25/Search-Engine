b'Vasya came up with his own weather forecasting method. He knows the information about the average air temperature for each of the last n days. Assume that the average air temperature for each day is integral.'
b"Vasya believes that if the average temperatures over the last n days form an arithmetic progression, where the first term equals to the average temperature on the first day, the second term equals to the average temperature on the second day and so on, then the average temperature of the next (n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)-th day will be equal to the next term of the arithmetic progression. Otherwise, according to Vasya's method, the temperature of the (n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)-th day will be equal to the temperature of the n-th day."
b'Your task is to help Vasya predict the average temperature for tomorrow, i. e. for the (n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)-th day.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of days for which the average air temperature is known.'
b'The second line contains a sequence of integers t1,\xe2\x80\x89t2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89tn (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891000\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ti\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 where ti is the average temperature in the i-th day.'
b'Output'
b'Print the average air temperature in the (n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)-th day, which Vasya predicts according to his method. Note that the absolute value of the predicted temperature can exceed 1000.'
