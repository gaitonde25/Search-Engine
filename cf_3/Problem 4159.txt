b'Arpa is taking a geometry exam. Here is the last problem of the exam.'
b'You are given three points a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c.'
b'Find a point and an angle such that if we rotate the page around the point by the angle, the new position of a is the same as the old position of b, and the new position of b is the same as the old position of c.'
b'Arpa is doubting if the problem has a solution or not (i.e. if there exists a point and an angle satisfying the condition). Help Arpa determine if the question has a solution or not.'
b'Input'
b"The only line contains six integers ax,\xe2\x80\x89ay,\xe2\x80\x89bx,\xe2\x80\x89by,\xe2\x80\x89cx,\xe2\x80\x89cy (|ax|,\xe2\x80\x89|ay|,\xe2\x80\x89|bx|,\xe2\x80\x89|by|,\xe2\x80\x89|cx|,\xe2\x80\x89|cy|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109). It's guaranteed that the points are distinct."
b'Output'
b'Print "Yes" if the problem has a solution, "No" otherwise.'
b'You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
