b"Wojtek has just won a maths competition in Byteland! The prize is admirable \xe2\x80\x94 a great book called 'Card Tricks for Everyone.' 'Great!' he thought, 'I can finally use this old, dusted deck of cards that's always been lying unused on my desk!'"
b"The first chapter of the book is 'How to Shuffle kk Cards in Any Order You Want.' It's basically a list of nn intricate methods of shuffling the deck of kk cards in a deterministic way. Specifically, the ii-th recipe can be described as a permutation (Pi,1,Pi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Pi,k)(Pi,1,Pi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Pi,k) of integers from 11 to kk. If we enumerate the cards in the deck from 11 to kk from top to bottom, then Pi,jPi,j indicates the number of the jj-th card from the top of the deck after the shuffle."
b'The day is short and Wojtek wants to learn only some of the tricks today. He will pick two integers l,rl,r (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n), and he will memorize each trick from the ll-th to the rr-th, inclusive. He will then take a sorted deck of kk cards and repeatedly apply random memorized tricks until he gets bored. He still likes maths, so he started wondering: how many different decks can he have after he stops shuffling it?'
b"Wojtek still didn't choose the integers ll and rr, but he is still curious. Therefore, he defined f(l,r)f(l,r) as the number of different decks he can get if he memorizes all the tricks between the ll-th and the rr-th, inclusive. What is the value of"
b'\xe2\x88\x91l=1n\xe2\x88\x91r=lnf(l,r)?\xe2\x88\x91l=1n\xe2\x88\x91r=lnf(l,r)?'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains two integers nn, kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa45) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of tricks and the number of cards in Wojtek's deck."
b'Each of the following nn lines describes a single trick and is described by kk distinct integers Pi,1,Pi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Pi,kPi,1,Pi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Pi,k (1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi,j\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi,j\xe2\x89\xa4k).'
b'Output'
b'Output the value of the sum described in the statement.'
