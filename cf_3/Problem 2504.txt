b"You are given two binary strings xx and yy, which are binary representations of some two integers (let's denote these integers as f(x)f(x) and f(y)f(y)). You can choose any integer k\xe2\x89\xa50k\xe2\x89\xa50, calculate the expression sk=f(x)+f(y)\xe2\x8b\x852ksk=f(x)+f(y)\xe2\x8b\x852k and write the binary representation of sksk in reverse order (let's denote it as revkrevk). For example, let x=1010x=1010 and y=11y=11; you've chosen k=1k=1 and, since 21=10221=102, so sk=10102+112\xe2\x8b\x85102=100002sk=10102+112\xe2\x8b\x85102=100002 and revk=00001revk=00001."
b'For given xx and yy, you need to choose such kk that revkrevk is lexicographically minimal (read notes if you don\'t know what does "lexicographically" means).'
b"It's guaranteed that, with given constraints, kk exists and is finite."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'Next 2T2T lines contain a description of queries: two lines per query. The first line contains one binary string xx, consisting of no more than 105105 characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.'
b'The second line contains one binary string yy, consisting of no more than 105105 characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.'
b"It's guaranteed, that 1\xe2\x89\xa4f(y)\xe2\x89\xa4f(x)1\xe2\x89\xa4f(y)\xe2\x89\xa4f(x) (where f(x)f(x) is the integer represented by xx, and f(y)f(y) is the integer represented by yy), both representations don't have any leading zeroes, the total length of xx over all queries doesn't exceed 105105, and the total length of yy over all queries doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'Print TT integers (one per query). For each query print such kk that revkrevk is lexicographically minimal.'
