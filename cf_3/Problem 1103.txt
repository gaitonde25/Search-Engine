b'Nezzar loves the game osu!.'
b'osu! is played on beatmaps, which can be seen as an array consisting of distinct points on a plane. A beatmap is called nice if for any three consecutive points A,B,CA,B,C listed in order, the angle between these three points, centered at BB, is strictly less than 9090 degrees.'
b'  Points A,B,CA,B,C on the left have angle less than 9090 degrees, so they can be three consecutive points of a nice beatmap; Points A\xe2\x80\xb2,B\xe2\x80\xb2,C\xe2\x80\xb2A\xe2\x80\xb2,B\xe2\x80\xb2,C\xe2\x80\xb2 on the right have angle greater or equal to 9090 degrees, so they cannot be three consecutive points of a nice beatmap. '
b'Now Nezzar has a beatmap of nn distinct points A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,An. Nezzar would like to reorder these nn points so that the resulting beatmap is nice.'
b'Formally, you are required to find a permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn of integers from 11 to nn, such that beatmap Ap1,Ap2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ApnAp1,Ap2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Apn is nice. If it is impossible, you should determine it.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000).'
b'Then nn lines follow, ii-th of them contains two integers xixi, yiyi (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of point AiAi.'
b'It is guaranteed that all points are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'If there is no solution, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Otherwise, print nn integers, representing a valid permutation pp.'
b'If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any.'
