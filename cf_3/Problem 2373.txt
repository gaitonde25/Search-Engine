b'You are given two strings of equal length ss and tt consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations on these strings.'
b'During each operation you choose two adjacent characters in any string and assign the value of the first character to the value of the second or vice versa.'
b'For example, if ss is "acbc" you can get the following strings in one operation: '
b'  "aabc" (if you perform s2=s1s2=s1);  "ccbc" (if you perform s1=s2s1=s2);  "accc" (if you perform s3=s2s3=s2 or s3=s4s3=s4);  "abbc" (if you perform s2=s3s2=s3);  "acbb" (if you perform s4=s3s4=s3); '
b'Note that you can also apply this operation to the string tt.'
b'Please determine whether it is possible to transform ss into tt, applying the operation above any number of times.'
b'Note that you have to answer qq independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries. Each query is represented by two consecutive lines.'
b'The first line of each query contains the string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4100) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.'
b'The second line of each query contains the string tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4|t|\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4|t|\xe2\x89\xa4100, |t|=|s||t|=|s|) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.'
b'Output'
b'For each query, print "YES" if it is possible to make ss equal to tt, and "NO" otherwise.'
b'You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will all be recognized as positive answer).'
