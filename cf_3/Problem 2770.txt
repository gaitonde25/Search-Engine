b'Cat Furrier Transform is a popular algorithm among cat programmers to create longcats. As one of the greatest cat programmers ever exist, Neko wants to utilize this algorithm to create the perfect longcat.'
b'Assume that we have a cat with a number xx. A perfect longcat is a cat with a number equal 2m\xe2\x88\x9212m\xe2\x88\x921 for some non-negative integer mm. For example, the numbers 00, 11, 33, 77, 1515 and so on are suitable for the perfect longcats.'
b'In the Cat Furrier Transform, the following operations can be performed on xx:'
b'  (Operation A): you select any non-negative integer nn and replace xx with x\xe2\x8a\x95(2n\xe2\x88\x921)x\xe2\x8a\x95(2n\xe2\x88\x921), with \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 being a bitwise XOR operator. (Operation B): replace xx with x+1x+1. '
b'The first applied operation must be of type A, the second of type B, the third of type A again, and so on. Formally, if we number operations from one in the order they are executed, then odd-numbered operations must be of type A and the even-numbered operations must be of type B.'
b'Neko wants to produce perfect longcats at industrial scale, thus for each cat Neko only wants to perform at most 4040 operations. Can you help Neko writing a transformation plan?'
b'Note that it is not required to minimize the number of operations. You just need to use no more than 4040 operations.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains a single integer xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4106).'
b'Output'
b'The first line should contain a single integer tt (0\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4400\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa440)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of operations to apply.'
b'Then for each odd-numbered operation print the corresponding number nini in it. That is, print \xe2\x8c\x88t2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88t2\xe2\x8c\x89 integers nini (0\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa4300\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa430), denoting the replacement xx with x\xe2\x8a\x95(2ni\xe2\x88\x921)x\xe2\x8a\x95(2ni\xe2\x88\x921) in the corresponding step.'
b'If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them. It is possible to show, that there is at least one answer in the constraints of this problem.'
