b'Kuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of nn towns, numbered from 11 to nn, and n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns aa and bb. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns (u,v)(u,v) (u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v) and walk from uu using the shortest path to vv (note that (u,v)(u,v) is considered to be different from (v,u)(v,u)).'
b'Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index xx) and Beetopia (denoted with the index yy). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns (u,v)(u,v) if on the path from uu to vv, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro\xe2\x80\x99s body and sting him.'
b'Kuro wants to know how many pair of city (u,v)(u,v) he can take as his route. Since he\xe2\x80\x99s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, xx and yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n, x\xe2\x89\xa0yx\xe2\x89\xa0y) - the number of towns, index of the town Flowrisa and index of the town Beetopia, respectively.'
b'n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow, each line contains two integers aa and bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n, a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b), describes a road connecting two towns aa and bb.'
b'It is guaranteed that from each town, we can reach every other town in the city using the given roads. That is, the given map of towns and roads is a tree.'
b'Output'
b'A single integer resembles the number of pair of towns (u,v)(u,v) that Kuro can use as his walking route.'
