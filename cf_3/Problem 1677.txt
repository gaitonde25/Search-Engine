b"Ehab loves number theory, but for some reason he hates the number xx. Given an array aa, find the length of its longest subarray such that the sum of its elements isn't divisible by xx, or determine that such subarray doesn't exist."
b'An array aa is a subarray of an array bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains 2 integers nn and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the array aa and the number that Ehab hates.'
b'The second line contains nn space-separated integers a1a1, a2a2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, anan (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41040\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array aa.'
b'Output'
b"For each testcase, print the length of the longest subarray whose sum isn't divisible by xx. If there's no such subarray, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921."
