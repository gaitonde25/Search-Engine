b'After reaching your destination, you want to build a new colony on the new planet. Since this planet has many mountains and the colony must be built on a flat surface you decided to flatten the mountains using boulders (you are still dreaming so this makes sense to you).'
b'  '
b'You are given an array h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hnh1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hn, where hihi is the height of the ii-th mountain, and kk\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of boulders you have.'
b"You will start throwing boulders from the top of the first mountain one by one and they will roll as follows (let's assume that the height of the current mountain is hihi): "
b'  if hi\xe2\x89\xa5hi+1hi\xe2\x89\xa5hi+1, the boulder will roll to the next mountain;  if hi<hi+1hi<hi+1, the boulder will stop rolling and increase the mountain height by 11 (hi=hi+1hi=hi+1);  if the boulder reaches the last mountain it will fall to the waste collection system and disappear. '
b'You want to find the position of the kk-th boulder or determine that it will fall into the waste collection system.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. The first line in each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100; 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of mountains and the number of boulders.'
b'The second line contains nn integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hnh1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hn (1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the height of the mountains.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 100100.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if the kk-th boulder will fall into the collection system. Otherwise, print the position of the kk-th boulder.'
