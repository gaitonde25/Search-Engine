b"For the first time, Polycarp's startup ended the year with a profit! Now he is about to distribute kk burles as a bonus among nn employees."
b'It is known that the current salary of the ii-th employee is aiai and all the values of aiai in the company are different.'
b'Polycarp wants to distribute the kk burles between nn employees so this month the ii-th employee will be paid not aiai, but ai+diai+di (di\xe2\x89\xa50di\xe2\x89\xa50, didi is an integer), where didi is the bonus for the ii-th employee. Of course, d1+d2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+dn=kd1+d2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+dn=k.'
b'Polycarp will follow two rules for choosing the values didi:'
b'  the relative order of the salaries should not be changed: the employee with originally the highest salary (aiai is the maximum) should have the highest total payment after receiving their bonus (ai+diai+di is also the maximum), the employee whose salary was originally the second-largest should receive the second-largest total payment after receiving their bonus and so on.  to emphasize that annual profit is a group effort, Polycarp wants to minimize the maximum total payment to an employee (i.e minimize the maximum value of ai+diai+di). '
b'Help Polycarp decide the non-negative integer bonuses didi such that:'
b'  their sum is kk,  for each employee, the number of those who receive strictly more than them remains unchanged (that is, if you sort employees by aiai and by ai+diai+di, you get the same order of employees),  all ai+diai+di are different,  the maximum of the values ai+diai+di is the minimum possible. '
b'Help Polycarp and print any of the possible answers d1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dnd1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dn.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of employees and the total bonus.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn different integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109), where aiai is the current salary of the ii-th employee.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of all nn values in the input does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'Print the answers to tt test cases in the order they appear in the input. Print each answer as a sequence of non-negative integers d1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dnd1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dn. If there are several answers, print any of them.'
