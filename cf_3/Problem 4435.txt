b'Little boy Igor wants to become a traveller. At first, he decided to visit all the cities of his motherland\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Uzhlyandia.'
b'It is widely known that Uzhlyandia has n cities connected with m bidirectional roads. Also, there are no two roads in the country that connect the same pair of cities, but roads starting and ending in the same city can exist. Igor wants to plan his journey beforehand. Boy thinks a path is good if the path goes over m\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x892 roads twice, and over the other 2 exactly once. The good path can start and finish in any city of Uzhlyandia.'
b'Now he wants to know how many different good paths are in Uzhlyandia. Two paths are considered different if the sets of roads the paths goes over exactly once differ. Help Igor\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 calculate the number of good paths.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n, m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities and roads in Uzhlyandia, respectively.'
b'Each of the next m lines contains two integers u and v (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89u,\xe2\x80\x89v\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) that mean that there is road between cities u and v.'
b'It is guaranteed that no road will be given in the input twice. That also means that for every city there is no more than one road that connects the city to itself.'
b'Output'
b'Print out the only integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of good paths in Uzhlyandia.'
