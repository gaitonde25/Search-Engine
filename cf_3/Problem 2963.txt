b'You have a long stick, consisting of mm segments enumerated from 11 to mm. Each segment is 11 centimeter long. Sadly, some segments are broken and need to be repaired.'
b'You have an infinitely long repair tape. You want to cut some pieces from the tape and use them to cover all of the broken segments. To be precise, a piece of tape of integer length tt placed at some position ss will cover segments s,s+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,s+t\xe2\x88\x921s,s+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,s+t\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'You are allowed to cover non-broken segments; it is also possible that some pieces of tape will overlap.'
b'Time is money, so you want to cut at most kk continuous pieces of tape to cover all the broken segments. What is the minimum total length of these pieces?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, mm and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4109n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of broken segments, the length of the stick and the maximum number of pieces you can use.'
b'The second line contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4m)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the positions of the broken segments. These integers are given in increasing order, that is, b1<b2<\xe2\x80\xa6<bnb1<b2<\xe2\x80\xa6<bn.'
b'Output'
b'Print the minimum total length of the pieces.'
