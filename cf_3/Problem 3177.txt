b'The direction of the TV channel wants to invite some of these people to the debate. The set of invited spectators should satisfy three conditions:'
b'  at least half of spectators support Alice (i.e. 2\xe2\x8b\x85a\xe2\x89\xa5m2\xe2\x8b\x85a\xe2\x89\xa5m, where aa is number of spectators supporting Alice and mm is the total number of spectators),  at least half of spectators support Bob (i.e. 2\xe2\x8b\x85b\xe2\x89\xa5m2\xe2\x8b\x85b\xe2\x89\xa5m, where bb is number of spectators supporting Bob and mm is the total number of spectators),  the total influence of spectators is maximal possible. '
