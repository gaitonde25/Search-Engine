b"William is hosting a party for nn of his trader friends. They started a discussion on various currencies they trade, but there's an issue: not all of his trader friends like every currency. They like some currencies, but not others."
b"For each William's friend ii it is known whether he likes currency jj. There are mm currencies in total. It is also known that a trader may not like more than pp currencies."
b'Because friends need to have some common topic for discussions they need to find the largest by cardinality (possibly empty) subset of currencies, such that there are at least \xe2\x8c\x88n2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n2\xe2\x8c\x89 friends (rounded up) who like each currency in this subset.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers n,mn,m and pp (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa460,1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa415)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa460,1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa415), which is the number of trader friends, the number of currencies, the maximum number of currencies each friend can like.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contain mm characters. The jj-th character of ii-th line is 11 if friend ii likes the currency jj and 00 otherwise. It is guaranteed that the number of ones in each line does not exceed pp.'
b'Output'
b'Print a string of length mm, which defines the subset of currencies of the maximum size, which are liked by at least half of all friends. Currencies belonging to this subset must be signified by the character 11.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any.'
