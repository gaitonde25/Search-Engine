b'Roman and Denis are on the trip to the programming competition. Since the trip was long, they soon got bored, and hence decided to came up with something. Roman invented a pizza\'s recipe, while Denis invented a string multiplication. According to Denis, the result of multiplication (product) of strings ss of length mm and tt is a string t+s1+t+s2+\xe2\x80\xa6+t+sm+tt+s1+t+s2+\xe2\x80\xa6+t+sm+t, where sisi denotes the ii-th symbol of the string ss, and "+" denotes string concatenation. For example, the product of strings "abc" and "de" is a string "deadebdecde", while the product of the strings "ab" and "z" is a string "zazbz". Note, that unlike the numbers multiplication, the product of strings ss and tt is not necessarily equal to product of tt and ss.'
b'Roman was jealous of Denis, since he invented such a cool operation, and hence decided to invent something string-related too. Since Roman is beauty-lover, he decided to define the beauty of the string as the length of the longest substring, consisting of only one letter. For example, the beauty of the string "xayyaaabca" is equal to 33, since there is a substring "aaa", while the beauty of the string "qwerqwer" is equal to 11, since all neighboring symbols in it are different.'
b"In order to entertain Roman, Denis wrote down nn strings p1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn on the paper and asked him to calculate the beauty of the string (\xe2\x80\xa6(((p1\xe2\x8b\x85p2)\xe2\x8b\x85p3)\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x80\xa6)\xe2\x8b\x85pn(\xe2\x80\xa6(((p1\xe2\x8b\x85p2)\xe2\x8b\x85p3)\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x80\xa6)\xe2\x8b\x85pn, where s\xe2\x8b\x85ts\xe2\x8b\x85t denotes a multiplication of strings ss and tt. Roman hasn't fully realized how Denis's multiplication works, so he asked you for a help. Denis knows, that Roman is very impressionable, he guarantees, that the beauty of the resulting string is at most 109109."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of strings, wroted by Denis.'
b'Next nn lines contain non-empty strings p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn, consisting of lowercase english letters.'
b"It's guaranteed, that the total length of the strings pipi is at most 100000100000, and that's the beauty of the resulting product is at most 109109."
b'Output'
b'Print exactly one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the beauty of the product of the strings.'
