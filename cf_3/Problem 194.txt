b'Berland is a large country with developed airlines. In total, there are nn cities in the country that are historically served by the Berlaflot airline. The airline operates bi-directional flights between mm pairs of cities, ii-th of them connects cities with numbers aiai and bibi and has a price cici for a flight in both directions.'
b'It is known that Berlaflot flights can be used to get from any city to any other (possibly with transfers), and the cost of any route that consists of several consequent flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive of them. More formally, the cost of the route from a city t1t1 to a city tktk with (k\xe2\x88\x922)(k\xe2\x88\x922) transfers using cities t2,\xc2\xa0t3,\xc2\xa0t4,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6,\xc2\xa0tk\xe2\x88\x921t2,\xc2\xa0t3,\xc2\xa0t4,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6,\xc2\xa0tk\xe2\x88\x921 is equal to the maximum cost of flights from t1t1 to t2t2, from t2t2 to t3t3, from t3t3 to t4t4 and so on until the flight from tk\xe2\x88\x921tk\xe2\x88\x921 to tktk. Of course, all these flights must be operated by Berlaflot.'
b'A new airline, S8 Airlines, has recently started operating in Berland. This airline provides bi-directional flights between all pairs of cities that are not connected by Berlaflot direct flights. Thus, between each pair of cities there is a flight of either Berlaflot or S8 Airlines.'
b'The cost of S8 Airlines flights is calculated as follows: for each pair of cities xx and yy that is connected by a S8 Airlines flight, the cost of this flight is equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities xx and yy at Berlaflot according to the pricing described earlier.'
b'It is known that with the help of S8 Airlines flights you can get from any city to any other with possible transfers, and, similarly to Berlaflot, the cost of a route between any two cities that consists of several S8 Airlines flights is equal to the cost of the most expensive flight.'
b'Due to the increased competition with S8 Airlines, Berlaflot decided to introduce an air reform and change the costs of its flights. Namely, for the ii-th of its flight between the cities aiai and bibi, Berlaflot wants to make the cost of this flight equal to the minimum cost of the route between the cities aiai and bibi at S8 Airlines. Help Berlaflot managers calculate new flight costs.'
b'Input'
b'Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the amount of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm (4\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000004\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000, n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4200000n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4200000, m\xe2\x89\xa4(n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x922)2m\xe2\x89\xa4(n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x922)2)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the amount of cities in Berland and the amount of Berlaflot flights.'
b'The next mm lines contain the description of Berlaflot flights. The ii-th line contains three integers aiai, bibi and cici (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the numbers of cities that are connected with ii-th Berlaflot flight and the price of ii-th Berlaflot flight.'
b'It is guaranteed that no flight connects a city with itself, no two flights connect the same pair of cities. It is guaranteed that by using Berlaflot flights it is possible to get from any city to any other and by using S8 Airlines flights it is possible to get from any city to any other.'
b'Let NN be the sum of nn over all test cases and MM be the sum of mm over all test cases. It is guaranteed that N,M\xe2\x89\xa4200000N,M\xe2\x89\xa4200000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case you should print mm integers in a single line, ii-th of them should be the price of ii-th Berlaflot flight after the air reform.'
