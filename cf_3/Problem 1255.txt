b'There are nn bags with candies, initially the ii-th bag contains ii candies. You want all the bags to contain an equal amount of candies in the end. '
b'To achieve this, you will:'
b' Choose mm such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41000Perform mm operations. In the jj-th operation, you will pick one bag and add jj candies to all bags apart from the chosen one.'
b'Your goal is to find a valid sequence of operations after which all the bags will contain an equal amount of candies. '
b"It can be proved that for the given constraints such a sequence always exists.You don't have to minimize mm.If there are several valid sequences, you can output any."
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases.'
b'The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first and only line of each test case contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100). '
b'Output'
b'For each testcase, print two lines with your answer. '
b'In the first line print mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of operations you want to take. '
b'In the second line print mm positive integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ama1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,am (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n), where ajaj is the number of bag you chose on the jj-th operation.'
