b"For some binary string ss (i.e. each character sisi is either '0' or '1'), all pairs of consecutive (adjacent) characters were written. In other words, all substrings of length 22 were written. For each pair (substring of length 22), the number of '1' (ones) in it was calculated."
b'You are given three numbers:'
b'  n0n0 \xe2\x80\x94 the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 00;  n1n1 \xe2\x80\x94 the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 11;  n2n2 \xe2\x80\x94 the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 22. '
b'For example, for the string s=s="1110011110", the following substrings would be written: "11", "11", "10", "00", "01", "11", "11", "11", "10". Thus, n0=1n0=1, n1=3n1=3, n2=5n2=5.'
b'Your task is to restore any suitable binary string ss from the given values n0,n1,n2n0,n1,n2. It is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers n0,n1,n2n0,n1,n2 is greater than 00. Also, it is guaranteed that a solution exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.'
b'Each test case consists of one line which contains three integers n0,n1,n2n0,n1,n2 (0\xe2\x89\xa4n0,n1,n2\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4n0,n1,n2\xe2\x89\xa4100; n0+n1+n2>0n0+n1+n2>0). It is guaranteed that the answer for given n0,n1,n2n0,n1,n2 exists.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt lines. Each of the lines should contain a binary string corresponding to a test case. If there are several possible solutions, print any of them.'
