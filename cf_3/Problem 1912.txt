b"There is a frog staying to the left of the string s=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sns=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sn consisting of nn characters (to be more precise, the frog initially stays at the cell 00). Each character of ss is either 'L' or 'R'. It means that if the frog is staying at the ii-th cell and the ii-th character is 'L', the frog can jump only to the left. If the frog is staying at the ii-th cell and the ii-th character is 'R', the frog can jump only to the right. The frog can jump only to the right from the cell 00."
b'Note that the frog can jump into the same cell twice and can perform as many jumps as it needs.'
b"The frog wants to reach the n+1n+1-th cell. The frog chooses some positive integer value dd before the first jump (and cannot change it later) and jumps by no more than dd cells at once. I.e. if the ii-th character is 'L' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range [max(0,i\xe2\x88\x92d);i\xe2\x88\x921][max(0,i\xe2\x88\x92d);i\xe2\x88\x921], and if the ii-th character is 'R' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range [i+1;min(n+1;i+d)][i+1;min(n+1;i+d)]."
b"The frog doesn't want to jump far, so your task is to find the minimum possible value of dd such that the frog can reach the cell n+1n+1 from the cell 00 if it can jump by no more than dd cells at once. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to reach n+1n+1 from 00."
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b"The next tt lines describe test cases. The ii-th test case is described as a string ss consisting of at least 11 and at most 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105 characters 'L' and 'R'."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105 (\xe2\x88\x91|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\xe2\x88\x91|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible value of dd such that the frog can reach the cell n+1n+1 from the cell 00 if it jumps by no more than dd at once.'
