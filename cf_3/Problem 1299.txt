b"You are given a string ss of even length nn. String ss is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's."
b'String ss has exactly n2n2 zeroes and n2n2 ones (nn is even).'
b'In one operation you can reverse any substring of ss. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.'
b'What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string ss alternating? A string is alternating if si\xe2\x89\xa0si+1si\xe2\x89\xa0si+1 for all ii. There are two types of alternating strings in general: 01010101... or 10101010...'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105; nn is even)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of string ss.'
b'The second line of each test case contains a binary string ss of length nn (si\xe2\x88\x88si\xe2\x88\x88 {0, 1}). String ss has exactly n2n2 zeroes and n2n2 ones.'
b"It's guaranteed that the total sum of nn over test cases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the minimum number of operations to make ss alternating.'
