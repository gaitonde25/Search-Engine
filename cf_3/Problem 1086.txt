b"You finally woke up after this crazy dream and decided to walk around to clear your head. Outside you saw your house's fence\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 so plain and boring, that you'd like to repaint it."
b'  '
b'You have a fence consisting of nn planks, where the ii-th plank has the color aiai. You want to repaint the fence in such a way that the ii-th plank has the color bibi.'
b"You've invited mm painters for this purpose. The jj-th painter will arrive at the moment jj and will recolor exactly one plank to color cjcj. For each painter you can choose which plank to recolor, but you can't turn them down, i.\xc2\xa0e. each painter has to color exactly one plank."
b"Can you get the coloring bb you want? If it's possible, print for each painter which plank he must paint."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of planks in the fence and the number of painters.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial colors of the fence.'
b'The third line of each test case contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the desired colors of the fence.'
b'The fourth line of each test case contains mm integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cmc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cm (1\xe2\x89\xa4cj\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4cj\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the colors painters have.'
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of nn doesn't exceed 105105 and the sum of mm doesn't exceed 105105 over all test cases."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output "NO" if it is impossible to achieve the coloring bb.'
b'Otherwise, print "YES" and mm integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xmx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xm, where xjxj is the index of plank the jj-th painter should paint.'
b'You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" are all recognized as positive answer).'
