b'You are given four integers nn, c0c0, c1c1 and hh and a binary string ss of length nn.'
b'A binary string is a string consisting of characters 00 and 11.'
b'You can change any character of the string ss (the string should be still binary after the change). You should pay hh coins for each change.'
b'After some changes (possibly zero) you want to buy the string. To buy the string you should buy all its characters. To buy the character 00 you should pay c0c0 coins, to buy the character 11 you should pay c1c1 coins.'
b'Find the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next 2t2t lines contain descriptions of test cases.'
b'The first line of the description of each test case contains four integers nn, c0c0, c1c1, hh (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,c0,c1,h\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n,c0,c1,h\xe2\x89\xa41000).'
b'The second line of the description of each test case contains the binary string ss of length nn.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.'
