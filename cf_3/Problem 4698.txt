b'Polycarp is a regular customer at the restaurant "Ber Patio". He likes having lunches there.'
b'"Ber Patio" has special discount program for regular customers. A customer can collect bonuses and partially cover expenses in the restaurant.'
b"Let's assume a customer currently has b bonuses and she has to pay r burles for a lunch. In this case the customer can use bonuses (1 bonus = 1 burle) to reduce the payment. She can cover at most half of the payment using bonuses. However, 1 bonus will be added to the customer's bonus balance per each 10 burles she paid."
b'Formally:'
b"  a customer can choose any number x of bonuses to use ()),  the customer's bonus balance is reduced by x,  the customer pays r\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x burles,  the customer's bonus balance is increased by \xe2\x8c\x8a(r\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89x)\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x8910\xe2\x8c\x8b (i.e. integer division rounded down is used). "
b'Initially, there are b bonuses on Polycarp\'s account. Polycarp is going to have a lunch in "Ber Patio" for the next n days. He estimated the values a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an, where ai is the number of burles in a receipt for the i-th day. The sum over all receipts doesn\'t exceed 105 burles.'
b'Write a program to find the minimum number of burles Polycarp has to spend and an optimal strategy to use bonuses.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integer numbers n and b (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x895000, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105) \xe2\x80\x94 number of days and initial number of bonuses Polycarp has.'
b"The second line contains the integer sequence a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891000), where ai is the amount of burles in the i-th day's receipt."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of all receipts does not exceed 105 burles.'
b'Output'
b'On the first line, print the expected minimal number of burles to pay for all n receipts.'
b'On the second line, print the sequence of integer numbers b1,\xe2\x80\x89b2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89bn, where bi is the number of bonuses to use on the i-th day. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.'
