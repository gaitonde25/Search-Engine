b'On February 14 Denis decided to give Valentine to Nastya and did not come up with anything better than to draw a huge red heart on the door of the length kk (k\xe2\x89\xa53k\xe2\x89\xa53). Nastya was very confused by this present, so she decided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains.'
b'Mountains are described by a sequence of heights a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an in order from left to right (k\xe2\x89\xa4nk\xe2\x89\xa4n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are not equal to each other (that is, ai\xe2\x89\xa0ai+1ai\xe2\x89\xa0ai+1 for all ii from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921).'
b'Peaks of mountains on the segment [l,r][l,r] (from ll to rr) are called indexes ii such that l<i<rl<i<r, ai\xe2\x88\x921<aiai\xe2\x88\x921<ai and ai>ai+1ai>ai+1. It is worth noting that the boundary indexes ll and rr for the segment are not peaks. For example, if n=8n=8 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6]a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6], then the segment [1,8][1,8] has only two peaks (with indexes 33 and 66), and there are no peaks on the segment [3,6][3,6].'
b'To break the door, Nastya throws it to a segment [l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921][l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921] of consecutive mountains of length kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92k+11\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92k+1). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it breaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in different halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the mountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break into will be equal to p+1p+1, where pp is the number of peaks on the segment [l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921][l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921].'
b'Nastya wants to break it into as many pieces as possible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains [l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921][l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921] that the number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal segments, Nastya wants to find one for which the value ll is minimal.'
b'Formally, you need to choose a segment of mountains [l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921][l,l+k\xe2\x88\x921] that has the maximum number of peaks. Among all such segments, you need to find the segment that has the minimum possible value ll.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (3\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of mountains and the length of the door.'
b'The second line of the input data set contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109, ai\xe2\x89\xa0ai+1ai\xe2\x89\xa0ai+1) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the heights of mountains.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all the test cases will not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output two integers tt and ll \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of parts that the door can split into, and the left border of the segment of length kk that the door should be reset to.'
