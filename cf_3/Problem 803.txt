b"Let's call a string tt consisting of characters 0 and/or 1 beautiful, if either the number of occurrences of character 0 in this string does not exceed kk, or the number of occurrences of characters 1 in this string does not exceed kk (or both). For example, if k=3k=3, the strings 101010, 111, 0, 00000, 1111111000 are beautiful, and the strings 1111110000, 01010101 are not beautiful."
b'You are given a string ss. You have to divide it into the minimum possible number of beautiful strings, i.\xe2\x80\x89e., find a sequence of strings t1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tmt1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tm such that every titi is beautiful, t1+t2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+tm=st1+t2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+tm=s (where ++ is the concatenation operator), and mm is minimum possible.'
b'For every kk from 11 to |s||s|, find the minimum possible number of strings such that ss can be divided into them (i.\xe2\x80\x89e. the minimum possible mm in the partition).'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains one string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105). Each character of ss is either 0 or 1.'
b'Output'
b'Print |s||s| integers. The ii-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of strings in the partition of ss, when k=ik=i.'
