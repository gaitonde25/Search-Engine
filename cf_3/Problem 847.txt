b'After rejecting 1010010100 data structure problems, Errorgorn is very angry at Anton and decided to kill him.'
b'Anton\'s DNA can be represented as a string aa which only contains the characters "ANTON" (there are only 44 distinct characters). '
b"Errorgorn can change Anton's DNA into string bb which must be a permutation of aa. However, Anton's body can defend against this attack. In 11 second, his body can swap 22 adjacent characters of his DNA to transform it back to aa. Anton's body is smart and will use the minimum number of moves."
b"To maximize the chance of Anton dying, Errorgorn wants to change Anton's DNA the string that maximizes the time for Anton's body to revert his DNA. But since Errorgorn is busy making more data structure problems, he needs your help to find the best string BB. Can you help him?"
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'The first and only line of each testcase contains 11 string aa (1\xe2\x89\xa4|a|\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4|a|\xe2\x89\xa4100000). aa consists of only the characters "A", "N", "O" and "T".'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of |a||a| over all testcases does not exceed 100000100000.'
b'Output'
b'For each testcase, print a single string, bb. If there are multiple answers, you can output any one of them. bb must be a permutation of the string aa.'
