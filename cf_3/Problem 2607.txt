b"Now Heidi is ready to crack Madame Kovarian's hashing function."
b'Madame Kovarian has a very strict set of rules for name changes. Two names can be interchanged only if using the following hashing function on them results in a collision. However, the hashing function is parametrized, so one can always find a set of parameters that causes such a collision. Heidi decided to exploit this to her advantage.'
b'Given two strings w1w1, w2w2 of equal length nn consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer mm.'
b'Consider the standard polynomial hashing function:'
b'Hp(w):=(\xe2\x88\x91|w|\xe2\x88\x921i=0wiri)mod(p)Hp(w):=(\xe2\x88\x91i=0|w|\xe2\x88\x921wiri)mod(p)'
b'where pp is some prime, and rr is some number such that 2\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x88\x9222\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x88\x922.'
b'The goal is to find rr and a prime pp (m\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4109m\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4109) such that Hp(w1)=Hp(w2)Hp(w1)=Hp(w2).'
b'Strings w1w1 and w2w2 are sampled independently at random from all strings of length nn over lowercase English letters.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (10\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410510\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 2\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The second and the third line, respectively, contain the words w1w1, w2w2 that were sampled independently at random from all strings of length nn over lowercase English letters.'
b'Output'
b'Output integers p,rp,r.'
b'pp should be a prime in the range [m,109][m,109] and rr should be an integer satisfying r\xe2\x88\x88[2,p\xe2\x88\x922]r\xe2\x88\x88[2,p\xe2\x88\x922].'
b'At least one solution is guaranteed to exist. In case multiple solutions exist, print any of them.'
