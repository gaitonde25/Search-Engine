b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'We hid from you a permutation pp of length nn, consisting of the elements from 11 to nn. You want to guess it. To do that, you can give us 2 different indices ii and jj, and we will reply with pimodpjpimodpj (remainder of division pipi by pjpj).'
b'We have enough patience to answer at most 2\xe2\x8b\x85n2\xe2\x8b\x85n queries, so you should fit in this constraint. Can you do it?'
b'As a reminder, a permutation of length nn is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).'
b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 length of the permutation.'
