b"Boy Dima gave Julian a birthday present\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 set BB consisting of positive integers. However, he didn't know, that Julian hates sets, but enjoys bipartite graphs more than anything else!"
b'Julian was almost upset, but her friend Alex said, that he can build an undirected graph using this set in such a way: let all integer numbers be vertices, then connect any two ii and jj with an edge if |i\xe2\x88\x92j||i\xe2\x88\x92j| belongs to BB.'
b"Unfortunately, Julian doesn't like the graph, that was built using BB. Alex decided to rectify the situation, so he wants to erase some numbers from BB, so that graph built using the new set is bipartite. The difficulty of this task is that the graph, Alex has to work with, has an infinite number of vertices and edges! It is impossible to solve this task alone, so Alex asks you for help. Write a program that erases a subset of minimum size from BB so that graph constructed on the new set is bipartite."
b'Recall, that graph is bipartite if all its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from different sets.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains an integer n\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\xa9\xbdn\xe2\xa9\xbd200000)n\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\xa9\xbdn\xe2\xa9\xbd200000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 size of BB'
b'Second line contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\xa9\xbdbi\xe2\xa9\xbd1018)b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\xa9\xbdbi\xe2\xa9\xbd1018)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 numbers of BB, all bibi are unique'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print single integer kk \xe2\x80\x93 the number of erased elements. In the second line print kk integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 values of erased elements.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
