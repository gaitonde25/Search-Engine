b"You are given a string ss consisting only of first 2020 lowercase Latin letters ('a', 'b', ..., 't')."
b'Recall that the substring s[l;r]s[l;r] of the string ss is the string slsl+1\xe2\x80\xa6srslsl+1\xe2\x80\xa6sr. For example, the substrings of "codeforces" are "code", "force", "f", "for", but not "coder" and "top".'
b'You can perform the following operation no more than once: choose some substring s[l;r]s[l;r] and reverse it (i.e. the string slsl+1\xe2\x80\xa6srslsl+1\xe2\x80\xa6sr becomes srsr\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\xa6slsrsr\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\xa6sl).'
b'Your goal is to maximize the length of the maximum substring of ss consisting of distinct (i.e. unique) characters.'
b'The string consists of distinct characters if no character in this string appears more than once. For example, strings "abcde", "arctg" and "minecraft" consist of distinct characters but strings "codeforces", "abacaba" do not consist of distinct characters.'
b'Input'
b"The only line of the input contains one string ss consisting of no more than 106106 characters 'a', 'b', ..., 't' (first 2020 lowercase Latin letters)."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible length of the maximum substring of ss consisting of distinct characters after reversing no more than one its substring.'
