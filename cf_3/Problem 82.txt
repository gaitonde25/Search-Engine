b'You are given a grid with nn rows and mm columns. Rows and columns are numbered from 11 to nn, and from 11 to mm. The intersection of the aa-th row and bb-th column is denoted by (a,b)(a,b). '
b'Initially, you are standing in the top left corner (1,1)(1,1). Your goal is to reach the bottom right corner (n,m)(n,m).'
b'You can move in four directions from (a,b)(a,b): up to (a\xe2\x88\x921,b)(a\xe2\x88\x921,b), down to (a+1,b)(a+1,b), left to (a,b\xe2\x88\x921)(a,b\xe2\x88\x921) or right to (a,b+1)(a,b+1).'
b'You cannot move in the same direction in two consecutive moves, and you cannot leave the grid. What is the minimum number of moves to reach (n,m)(n,m)?'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the test cases. The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the grid.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single integer: \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to reach (n,m)(n,m) under the given conditions, otherwise the minimum number of moves.'
