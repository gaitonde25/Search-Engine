b'You are given an undirected unrooted tree, i.e. a connected undirected graph without cycles.'
b'You must assign a nonzero integer weight to each vertex so that the following is satisfied: if any vertex of the tree is removed, then each of the remaining connected components has the same sum of weights in its vertices.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices of the tree.'
b'The next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines of each case contain each two integers u,vu,v (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n) denoting that there is an edge between vertices uu and vv. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'The sum of nn for all test cases is at most 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, you must output one line with nn space separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an, where aiai is the weight assigned to vertex ii. The weights must satisfy \xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105 and ai\xe2\x89\xa00ai\xe2\x89\xa00.'
b'It can be shown that there always exists a solution satisfying these constraints. If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of them.'
