b'A tree is an undirected graph with exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. We call a set of simple paths kk-valid if each vertex of the tree belongs to no more than one of these paths (including endpoints) and each path consists of exactly kk vertices.'
b'You are given a tree with nn vertices. For each kk from 11 to nn inclusive find what is the maximum possible size of a kk-valid set of simple paths.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b'Then following n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describe the tree, each of them contains two integers vv, uu (1\xe2\x89\xa4v,u\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4v,u\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 endpoints of the corresponding edge.'
b'It is guaranteed, that the given graph is a tree. '
b'Output'
b'Output nn numbers, the ii-th of which is the maximum possible number of paths in an ii-valid set of paths.'
