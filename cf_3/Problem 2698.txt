b'A telephone number is a sequence of exactly 11 digits, where the first digit is 8. For example, the sequence 80011223388 is a telephone number, but the sequences 70011223388 and 80000011223388 are not.'
b'You are given a string ss of length nn, consisting of digits.'
b'In one operation you can delete any character from string ss. For example, it is possible to obtain strings 112, 111 or 121 from string 1121.'
b'You need to determine whether there is such a sequence of operations (possibly empty), after which the string ss becomes a telephone number.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of string ss.'
b'The second line of each test case contains the string ss (|s|=n|s|=n) consisting of digits.'
b'Output'
b'For each test print one line.'
b'If there is a sequence of operations, after which ss becomes a telephone number, print YES.'
b'Otherwise, print NO.'
