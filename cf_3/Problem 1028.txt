b'Three swimmers decided to organize a party in the swimming pool! At noon, they started to swim from the left side of the pool.'
b'It takes the first swimmer exactly aa minutes to swim across the entire pool and come back, exactly bb minutes for the second swimmer and cc minutes for the third. Hence, the first swimmer will be on the left side of the pool after 00, aa, 2a2a, 3a3a, ... minutes after the start time, the second one will be at 00, bb, 2b2b, 3b3b, ... minutes, and the third one will be on the left side of the pool after 00, cc, 2c2c, 3c3c, ... minutes.'
b'You came to the left side of the pool exactly pp minutes after they started swimming. Determine how long you have to wait before one of the swimmers arrives at the left side of the pool.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next tt lines contains test case descriptions, one per line.'
b'Each line contains four integers pp, aa, bb and cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4p,a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4p,a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa41018), time in minutes after the start, when you came to the pool and times in minutes it take the swimmers to cross the entire pool and come back.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 how long you have to wait (in minutes) before one of the swimmers arrives at the left side of the pool.'
