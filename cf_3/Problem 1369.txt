b'The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for 130130 years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem:'
b'Given a number mm, how many polynomials PP with coefficients in set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} have: P(2)=mP(2)=m?'
b'Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105) - number of test cases.'
b'On next line there are tt numbers, mimi (1\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x89\xa41018)(1\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x89\xa41018) - meaning that in case ii you should solve for number mimi.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case ii, print the answer on separate lines: number of polynomials PP as described in statement such that P(2)=miP(2)=mi, modulo 109+7109+7.'
