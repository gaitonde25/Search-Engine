b'Dreamoon is a big fan of the Codeforces contests.'
b"One day, he claimed that he will collect all the places from 11 to 5454 after two more rated contests. It's amazing!"
b'Based on this, you come up with the following problem:'
b'There is a person who participated in nn Codeforces rounds. His place in the first round is a1a1, his place in the second round is a2a2, ..., his place in the nn-th round is anan.'
b'You are given a positive non-zero integer xx.'
b'Please, find the largest vv such that this person can collect all the places from 11 to vv after xx more rated contests.'
b'In other words, you need to find the largest vv, such that it is possible, that after xx more rated contests, for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4v1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4v, there will exist a contest where this person took the ii-th place.'
b'For example, if n=6n=6, x=2x=2 and a=[3,1,1,5,7,10]a=[3,1,1,5,7,10] then answer is v=5v=5, because if on the next two contest he will take places 22 and 44, then he will collect all places from 11 to 55, so it is possible to get v=5v=5.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45) denoting the number of test cases in the input.'
b'Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n,xn,x (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,x\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n,x\xe2\x89\xa4100). The second line contains nn positive non-zero integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print one line containing the largest vv, such that it is possible that after xx other contests, for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4v1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4v, there will exist a contest where this person took the ii-th place.'
