b'Homer has two friends Alice and Bob. Both of them are string fans. '
b'One day, Alice and Bob decide to play a game on a string s=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sns=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sn of length nn consisting of lowercase English letters. They move in turns alternatively and Alice makes the first move.'
b'In a move, a player must choose an index ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) that has not been chosen before, and change sisi to any other lowercase English letter cc that c\xe2\x89\xa0sic\xe2\x89\xa0si.'
b'When all indices have been chosen, the game ends. '
b'The goal of Alice is to make the final string lexicographically as small as possible, while the goal of Bob is to make the final string lexicographically as large as possible. Both of them are game experts, so they always play games optimally. Homer is not a game expert, so he wonders what the final string will be.'
b'A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds: '
b'  aa is a prefix of bb, but a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb. '
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The only line of each test case contains a single string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa450) consisting of lowercase English letters.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the final string in a single line.'
