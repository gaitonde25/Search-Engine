b'Two people are playing a game with a string ss, consisting of lowercase latin letters. '
b"On a player's turn, he should choose two consecutive equal letters in the string and delete them. "
b'For example, if the string is equal to "xaax" than there is only one possible turn: delete "aa", so the string will become "xx". A player not able to make a turn loses.'
b'Your task is to determine which player will win if both play optimally.'
b'Input'

b'Output'
