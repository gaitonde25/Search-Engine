b'Mr. Kitayuta has kindly given you a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. You are asked to insert exactly n lowercase English letters into s to make it a palindrome. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "noon", "testset" and "a" are all palindromes, while "test" and "kitayuta" are not.) You can choose any n lowercase English letters, and insert each of them to any position of s, possibly to the beginning or the end of s. You have to insert exactly n letters even if it is possible to turn s into a palindrome by inserting less than n letters.'
b'Find the number of the palindromes that can be obtained in this way, modulo 10007.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a string s (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|s|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89200). Each character in s is a lowercase English letter.'
b'The second line contains an integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109).'
b'Output'
b'Print the number of the palindromes that can be obtained, modulo 10007.'
