b'Nauuo is a girl who loves coding.'
b'One day she was solving a problem which requires to calculate a sum of some numbers modulo pp.'
b'She wrote the following code and got the verdict "Wrong answer".'
b''
b'She soon discovered the bug \xe2\x80\x94 the ModAdd function only worked for numbers in the range [0,p)[0,p), but the numbers in the problem may be out of the range. She was curious about the wrong function, so she wanted to know the result of it.'
b'However, the original code worked too slow, so she asked you to help her.'
b'You are given an array a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an and a number pp. Nauuo will make mm queries, in each query, you are given ll and rr, and you have to calculate the results of Sum(a,l,r,p). You can see the definition of the Sum function in the pseudocode above.'
b"Note that the integers won't overflow in the code above."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, mm, pp (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the given array, the number of queries and the modulus. Note that the modulus is used only in the ModAdd function.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the given array.'
b'In the following mm lines, each line contains two integers ll, rr (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 you have to calculate the result of Sum(a,l,r,p).'
b'Output'
b'The output contains mm integers to answer the queries in the given order.'
