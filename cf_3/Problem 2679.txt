b'Polycarp has nn wheels and a car with mm slots for wheels. The initial pressure in the ii-th wheel is aiai.'
b"Polycarp's goal is to take exactly mm wheels among the given nn wheels and equalize the pressure in them (then he can put these wheels in a car and use it for driving). In one minute he can decrease or increase the pressure in any (single) wheel by 11. He can increase the pressure no more than kk times in total because it is hard to pump up wheels."
b'Help Polycarp and say what is the minimum number of minutes he needs to spend to equalize the pressure of at least mm wheels among the given nn wheels.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains three integers n,mn,m and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of wheels, the number of slots for wheels in a car and the number of times Polycarp can increase by 11 the pressure in a wheel.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109), where aiai is the pressure in the ii-th wheel.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of minutes Polycarp needs to spend to equalize the pressure in at least mm wheels among the given nn wheels.'
