b'You are given two integers ll and rr.'
b"Let's call an integer xx modest, if l\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4rl\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4r."
b'Find a string of length nn, consisting of digits, which has the largest possible number of substrings, which make a modest integer. Substring having leading zeros are not counted. If there are many answers, find lexicographically smallest one.'
b'If some number occurs multiple times as a substring, then in the counting of the number of modest substrings it is counted multiple times as well.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer ll (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4108001\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa410800).'
b'The second line contains one integer rr (l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa410800l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa410800).'
b'The third line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000).'
b'Output'
b'In the first line, print the maximum possible number of modest substrings.'
b'In the second line, print a string of length nn having exactly that number of modest substrings.'
b'If there are multiple such strings, print the lexicographically smallest of them.'
