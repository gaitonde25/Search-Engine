b'The Oak has nn nesting places, numbered with integers from 11 to nn. Nesting place ii is home to bibi bees and wiwi wasps.'
b'Some nesting places are connected by branches. We call two nesting places adjacent if there exists a branch between them. A simple path from nesting place xx to yy is given by a sequence s0,\xe2\x80\xa6,sps0,\xe2\x80\xa6,sp of distinct nesting places, where pp is a non-negative integer, s0=xs0=x, sp=ysp=y, and si\xe2\x88\x921si\xe2\x88\x921 and sisi are adjacent for each i=1,\xe2\x80\xa6,pi=1,\xe2\x80\xa6,p. The branches of The Oak are set up in such a way that for any two pairs of nesting places xx and yy, there exists a unique simple path from xx to yy. Because of this, biologists and computer scientists agree that The Oak is in fact, a tree.'
b'A village is a nonempty set VV of nesting places such that for any two xx and yy in VV, there exists a simple path from xx to yy whose intermediate nesting places all lie in VV. '
b'A set of villages PP is called a partition if each of the nn nesting places is contained in exactly one of the villages in PP. In other words, no two villages in PP share any common nesting place, and altogether, they contain all nn nesting places.'
b'The Oak holds its annual Miss Punyverse beauty pageant. The two contestants this year are Ugly Wasp and Pretty Bee. The winner of the beauty pageant is determined by voting, which we will now explain. Suppose PP is a partition of the nesting places into mm villages V1,\xe2\x80\xa6,VmV1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Vm. There is a local election in each village. Each of the insects in this village vote for their favorite contestant. If there are strictly more votes for Ugly Wasp than Pretty Bee, then Ugly Wasp is said to win in that village. Otherwise, Pretty Bee wins. Whoever wins in the most number of villages wins.'
b'As it always goes with these pageants, bees always vote for the bee (which is Pretty Bee this year) and wasps always vote for the wasp (which is Ugly Wasp this year). Unlike their general elections, no one abstains from voting for Miss Punyverse as everyone takes it very seriously.'
b'Mayor Waspacito, and his assistant Alexwasp, wants Ugly Wasp to win. He has the power to choose how to partition The Oak into exactly mm villages. If he chooses the partition optimally, determine the maximum number of villages in which Ugly Wasp wins.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases. '
b'The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa430001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43000). The second line contains nn space-separated integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109). The third line contains nn space-separated integers w1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wnw1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wn (0\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4109). The next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describe the pairs of adjacent nesting places. In particular, the ii-th of them contains two space-separated integers xixi and yiyi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n, xi\xe2\x89\xa0yixi\xe2\x89\xa0yi) denoting the numbers of two adjacent nesting places. It is guaranteed that these pairs form a tree.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn in a single file is at most 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum number of villages in which Ugly Wasp wins, among all partitions of The Oak into mm villages.'
