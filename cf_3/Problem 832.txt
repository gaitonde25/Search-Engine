b'Eshag has an array aa consisting of nn integers.'
b'Eshag can perform the following operation any number of times: choose some subsequence of aa and delete every element from it which is strictly larger than AVGAVG, where AVGAVG is the average of the numbers in the chosen subsequence.'
b'For example, if a=[1,4,3,2,4]a=[1,4,3,2,4] and Eshag applies the operation to the subsequence containing a1a1, a2a2, a4a4 and a5a5, then he will delete those of these 44 elements which are larger than a1+a2+a4+a54=114a1+a2+a4+a54=114, so after the operation, the array aa will become a=[1,3,2]a=[1,3,2].'
b'Your task is to find the maximum number of elements Eshag can delete from the array aa by applying the operation described above some number (maybe, zero) times.'
b'A sequence bb is a subsequence of an array cc if bb can be obtained from cc by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the array aa.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100)(1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array aa.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of elements Eshag can delete from the array aa.'
