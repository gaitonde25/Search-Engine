b'Little Susie, thanks to her older brother, likes to play with cars. Today she decided to set up a tournament between them. The process of a tournament is described in the next paragraph.'
b'There are n toy cars. Each pair collides. The result of a collision can be one of the following: no car turned over, one car turned over, both cars turned over. A car is good if it turned over in no collision. The results of the collisions are determined by an n\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89n matrix \xd0\x90: there is a number on the intersection of the \xd1\x96-th row and j-th column that describes the result of the collision of the \xd1\x96-th and the j-th car: '
b'  \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891: if this pair of cars never collided. \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 occurs only on the main diagonal of the matrix.  0: if no car turned over during the collision.  1: if only the i-th car turned over during the collision.  2: if only the j-th car turned over during the collision.  3: if both cars turned over during the collision. '
b'Susie wants to find all the good cars. She quickly determined which cars are good. Can you cope with the task?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cars.'
b'Each of the next n lines contains n space-separated integers that determine matrix A. '
b"It is guaranteed that on the main diagonal there are \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891, and \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 doesn't appear anywhere else in the matrix."
b'It is guaranteed that the input is correct, that is, if Aij\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891, then Aji\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892, if Aij\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893, then Aji\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893, and if Aij\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890, then Aji\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.'
b'Output'
b'Print the number of good cars and in the next line print their space-separated indices in the increasing order.'
