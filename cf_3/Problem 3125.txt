b"Polycarp's phone book contains nn phone numbers, each of them is described by sisi \xe2\x80\x94 the number itself and mimi \xe2\x80\x94 the number of times Polycarp dials it in daily."
b'Polycarp has just bought a brand new phone with an amazing speed dial feature! More precisely, kk buttons on it can have a number assigned to it (not necessary from the phone book). To enter some number Polycarp can press one of these kk buttons and then finish the number using usual digit buttons (entering a number with only digit buttons is also possible).'
b'Speed dial button can only be used when no digits are entered. No button can have its number reassigned.'
b'What is the minimal total number of digit number presses Polycarp can achieve after he assigns numbers to speed dial buttons and enters each of the numbers from his phone book the given number of times in an optimal way?'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410) \xe2\x80\x94 the amount of numbers in Polycarp's phone book and the number of speed dial buttons his new phone has."
b'The ii-th of the next nn lines contain a string sisi and an integer mimi (1\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x89\xa4500)(1\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x89\xa4500), where sisi is a non-empty string of digits from 00 to 99 inclusive (the ii-th number), and mimi is the amount of times it will be dialed, respectively.'
b'It is guaranteed that the total length of all phone numbers will not exceed 500500.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimal total number of digit number presses Polycarp can achieve after he assigns numbers to speed dial buttons and enters each of the numbers from his phone book the given number of times in an optimal way.'
