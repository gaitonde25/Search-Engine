b'The competitors of Bubble Cup X gathered after the competition and discussed what is the best way to get to know the host country and its cities.'
b'After exploring the map of Serbia for a while, the competitors came up with the following facts: the country has V cities which are indexed with numbers from 1 to V, and there are E bi-directional roads that connect the cites. Each road has a weight (the time needed to cross that road). There are N teams at the Bubble Cup and the competitors came up with the following plan: each of the N teams will start their journey in one of the V cities, and some of the teams share the starting position.'
b"They want to find the shortest time T, such that every team can move in these T minutes, and the number of different cities they end up in is at least K (because they will only get to know the cities they end up in). A team doesn't have to be on the move all the time, if they like it in a particular city, they can stay there and wait for the time to pass."
b"Please help the competitors to determine the shortest time T so it's possible for them to end up in at least K different cities or print -1 if that is impossible no matter how they move."
b'Note that there can exist multiple roads between some cities.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains four integers: V, E, N and K (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89V\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89600,\xe2\x80\x89 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89E\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x8920000,\xe2\x80\x89 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89N\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89min(V,\xe2\x80\x89200),\xe2\x80\x89 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89K\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89N), number of cities, number of roads, number of teams and the smallest number of different cities they need to end up in, respectively.'
b'The second line contains N integers, the cities where the teams start their journey.'
b'Next E lines contain information about the roads in following format: Ai Bi Ti (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89Ai,\xe2\x80\x89Bi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89V,\xe2\x80\x89 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89Ti\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910000), which means that there is a road connecting cities Ai and Bi, and you need Ti minutes to cross that road.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer that represents the minimal time the teams can move for, such that they end up in at least K different cities or output -1 if there is no solution.'
b'If the solution exists, result will be no greater than 1731311.'
