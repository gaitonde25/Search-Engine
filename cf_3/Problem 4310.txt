b'Karen is getting ready for a new school day!'
b'  '
b'It is currently hh:mm, given in a 24-hour format. As you know, Karen loves palindromes, and she believes that it is good luck to wake up when the time is a palindrome.'
b'What is the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome?'
b'Remember that a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For instance, 05:39 is not a palindrome, because 05:39 backwards is 93:50. On the other hand, 05:50 is a palindrome, because 05:50 backwards is 05:50.'
b'Input'
b'The first and only line of input contains a single string in the format hh:mm (00\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89 hh \xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8923, 00\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89 mm \xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8959).'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer on a line by itself, the minimum number of minutes she should sleep, such that, when she wakes up, the time is a palindrome.'
