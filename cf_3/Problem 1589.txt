b'Ivan is fond of genealogy. Currently he is studying a particular genealogical structure, which consists of some people. In this structure every person has either both parents specified, or none. Additionally, each person has exactly one child, except for one special person, who does not have any children. The people in this structure are conveniently numbered from 11 to nn, and sisi denotes the child of the person ii (and si=0si=0 for exactly one person who does not have any children).'
b'We say that aa is an ancestor of bb if either a=ba=b, or aa has a child, who is an ancestor of bb. That is aa is an ancestor for aa, sasa, ssassa, etc.'
b'We say that person ii is imbalanced in case this person has both parents specified, and the total number of ancestors of one of the parents is at least double the other. '
b'Ivan counted the number of imbalanced people in the structure, and got kk people in total. However, he is not sure whether he computed it correctly, and would like to check if there is at least one construction with nn people that have kk imbalanced people in total. Please help him to find one such construction, or determine if it does not exist.'
b'Input'
b'The input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000, 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n), the total number of people and the number of imbalanced people.'
b'Output'
b'If there are no constructions with nn people and kk imbalanced people, output NO.'
b'Otherwise output YES on the first line, and then nn integers s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn (0\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4n), which describes the construction and specify the child of each node (or 0, if the person does not have any children).'
