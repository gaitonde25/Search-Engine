b"Alyona's mother wants to present an array of n non-negative integers to Alyona. The array should be special. "
b'Alyona is a capricious girl so after she gets the array, she inspects m of its subarrays. Subarray is a set of some subsequent elements of the array. The i-th subarray is described with two integers li and ri, and its elements are a[li],\xe2\x80\x89a[li\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891],\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89a[ri].'
b'Alyona is going to find mex for each of the chosen subarrays. Among these m mexes the girl is going to find the smallest. She wants this minimum mex to be as large as possible. '
b'You are to find an array a of n elements so that the minimum mex among those chosen by Alyona subarrays is as large as possible.'
b'The mex of a set S is a minimum possible non-negative integer that is not in S.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105).'
b'The next m lines contain information about the subarrays chosen by Alyona. The i-th of these lines contains two integers li and ri (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89li\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ri\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n), that describe the subarray a[li],\xe2\x80\x89a[li\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891],\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89a[ri].'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible minimum mex.'
b'In the second line print n integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the array a. All the elements in a should be between 0 and 109.'
b'It is guaranteed that there is an optimal answer in which all the elements in a are between 0 and 109.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.'
