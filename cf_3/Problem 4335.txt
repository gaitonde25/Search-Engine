b'Vladik had started reading a complicated book about algorithms containing n pages. To improve understanding of what is written, his friends advised him to read pages in some order given by permutation P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89[p1,\xe2\x80\x89p2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89pn], where pi denotes the number of page that should be read i-th in turn.'
b'Sometimes Vladik\xe2\x80\x99s mom sorted some subsegment of permutation P from position l to position r inclusive, because she loves the order. For every of such sorting Vladik knows number x\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 what index of page in permutation he should read. He is wondered if the page, which he will read after sorting, has changed. In other words, has px changed? After every sorting Vladik return permutation to initial state, so you can assume that each sorting is independent from each other.'
b'Input'
b"First line contains two space-separated integers n, m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 length of permutation and number of times Vladik's mom sorted some subsegment of the book."
b'Second line contains n space-separated integers p1,\xe2\x80\x89p2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89pn (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 permutation P. Note that elements in permutation are distinct.'
b'Each of the next m lines contains three space-separated integers li, ri, xi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89li\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89xi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ri\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 left and right borders of sorted subsegment in i-th sorting and position that is interesting to Vladik.'
b'Output'
b'For each mom\xe2\x80\x99s sorting on it\xe2\x80\x99s own line print "Yes", if page which is interesting to Vladik hasn\'t changed, or "No" otherwise.'
