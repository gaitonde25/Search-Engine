b'Recently, Olya received a magical square with the size of 2n\xc3\x972n2n\xc3\x972n.'
b'It seems to her sister that one square is boring. Therefore, she asked Olya to perform exactly kk splitting operations.'
b'A Splitting operation is an operation during which Olya takes a square with side aa and cuts it into 4 equal squares with side a2a2. If the side of the square is equal to 11, then it is impossible to apply a splitting operation to it (see examples for better understanding).'
b"Olya is happy to fulfill her sister's request, but she also wants the condition of Olya's happiness to be satisfied after all operations."
b"The condition of Olya's happiness will be satisfied if the following statement is fulfilled:"
b'Let the length of the side of the lower left square be equal to aa, then the length of the side of the right upper square should also be equal to aa. There should also be a path between them that consists only of squares with the side of length aa. All consecutive squares on a path should have a common side.'
b"Obviously, as long as we have one square, these conditions are met. So Olya is ready to fulfill her sister's request only under the condition that she is satisfied too. Tell her: is it possible to perform exactly kk splitting operations in a certain order so that the condition of Olya's happiness is satisfied? If it is possible, tell also the size of the side of squares of which the path from the lower left square to the upper right one will consist."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of tests.'
b"Each of the following tt lines contains two integers nini and kiki (1\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa4109,1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa4109,1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa41018)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the description of the ii-th test, which means that initially Olya's square has size of 2ni\xc3\x972ni2ni\xc3\x972ni and Olya's sister asks her to do exactly kiki splitting operations."
b'Output'
b'Print tt lines, where in the ii-th line you should output "YES" if it is possible to perform kiki splitting operations in the ii-th test in such a way that the condition of Olya\'s happiness is satisfied or print "NO" otherwise. If you printed "YES", then also print the log2log2 of the length of the side of the squares through space, along which you can build a path from the lower left square to the upper right one.'
b'You can output each letter in any case (lower or upper).'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any.'
