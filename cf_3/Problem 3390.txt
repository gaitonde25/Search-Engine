b'You are given a chessboard of size n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n. It is filled with numbers from 11 to n2n2 in the following way: the first \xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89 numbers from 11 to \xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89 are written in the cells with even sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The rest n2\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89n2\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89 numbers from \xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89+1\xe2\x8c\x88n22\xe2\x8c\x89+1 to n2n2 are written in the cells with odd sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The operation \xe2\x8c\x88xy\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88xy\xe2\x8c\x89 means division xx by yy rounded up.'
b'For example, the left board on the following picture is the chessboard which is given for n=4n=4 and the right board is the chessboard which is given for n=5n=5.'
b'  '
b'You are given qq queries. The ii-th query is described as a pair xi,yixi,yi. The answer to the ii-th query is the number written in the cell xi,yixi,yi (xixi is the row, yiyi is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from 11 to nn.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the board and the number of queries.'
b'The next qq lines contain two integers each. The ii-th line contains two integers xi,yixi,yi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 description of the ii-th query.'
b'Output'
b'For each query from 11 to qq print the answer to this query. The answer to the ii-th query is the number written in the cell xi,yixi,yi (xixi is the row, yiyi is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from 11 to nn. Queries are numbered from 11 to qq in order of the input.'
