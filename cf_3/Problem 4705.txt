b'There are n workers in a company, each of them has a unique id from 1 to n. Exaclty one of them is a chief, his id is s. Each worker except the chief has exactly one immediate superior.'
b"There was a request to each of the workers to tell how how many superiors (not only immediate).

The chief is a superior to all the workers except himself."
b'Some of the workers were in a hurry and made a mistake. You are to find the minimum number of workers that could make a mistake.'
