b'Recently, the Fair Nut has written kk strings of length nn, consisting of letters "a" and "b". He calculated cc\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of strings that are prefixes of at least one of the written strings. Every string was counted only one time.'
b'Then, he lost his sheet with strings. He remembers that all written strings were lexicographically not smaller than string ss and not bigger than string tt. He is interested: what is the maximum value of cc that he could get.'
b'A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds:'
b' aa is a prefix of bb, but a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b; in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The second line contains a string ss (|s|=n|s|=n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the string consisting of letters "a" and "b.'
b'The third line contains a string tt (|t|=n|t|=n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the string consisting of letters "a" and "b.'
b'It is guaranteed that string ss is lexicographically not bigger than tt.'
b'Output'
b'Print one number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 maximal value of cc.'
