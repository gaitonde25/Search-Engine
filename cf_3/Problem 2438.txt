b'Polycarp really likes writing the word "kotlin". He wrote this word several times in a row without spaces. For example, he could write the string like "kotlinkotlinkotlinkotlin".'
b'Polycarp sliced (cut) the written string into nn pieces and mixed them. As a result, he has nn strings s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn and he can arrange them in the right order, concatenate (join) all of them and get a string like "kotlinkotlin...kotlin".'
b'Help Polycarp to find the right order of strings s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn, so that if he writes the strings in this order, he will get the word "kotlin" or the sequence of this word.'
b'Pay attention that you must use all given strings and you must use each string only once.'
b'Input'
b"The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of Polycarp's strings. Next lines of the input contain nn Polycarp's strings."
b'Total sum of their lengths doesn\'t exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105. It\'s guaranteed that there is the right order of arrangement the strings that if you concatenate them into one string, you will get some non-empty sequence of the word "kotlin".'
b'Output'
b'Print nn different integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n), where pipi is an index of the string that should be the ii-th in a required concatenation. In other words, the result of concatenation sp1+sp2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+spnsp1+sp2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+spn must be in the form "kotlinkotlin...kotlin". If there are many solutions, print any of them.'
