b'NEKO#\xce\xa6\xcf\x89\xce\xa6 has just got a new maze game on her PC!'
b"The game's main puzzle is a maze, in the forms of a 2\xc3\x97n2\xc3\x97n rectangle grid. NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell (1,1)(1,1) to the gate at (2,n)(2,n) and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side."
b'However, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.'
b'After hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only qq such moments: the ii-th moment toggles the state of cell (ri,ci)(ri,ci) (either from ground to lava or vice versa).'
b'Knowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the qq moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell (1,1)(1,1) to cell (2,n)(2,n) without going through any lava cells.'
b"Although NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power. Can you help her?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integers nn, qq (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The ii-th of qq following lines contains two integers riri, cici (1\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa421\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa42, 1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n), denoting the coordinates of the cell to be flipped at the ii-th moment.'
b'It is guaranteed that cells (1,1)(1,1) and (2,n)(2,n) never appear in the query list.'
b'Output'
b'For each moment, if it is possible to travel from cell (1,1)(1,1) to cell (2,n)(2,n), print "Yes", otherwise print "No". There should be exactly qq answers, one after every update.'
b'You can print the words in any case (either lowercase, uppercase or mixed).'
