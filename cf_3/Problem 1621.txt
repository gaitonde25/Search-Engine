b"In Omkar's last class of math, he learned about the least common multiple, or LCMLCM. LCM(a,b)LCM(a,b) is the smallest positive integer xx which is divisible by both aa and bb."
b'Omkar, having a laudably curious mind, immediately thought of a problem involving the LCMLCM operation: given an integer nn, find positive integers aa and bb such that a+b=na+b=n and LCM(a,b)LCM(a,b) is the minimum value possible.'
b'Can you help Omkar solve his ludicrously challenging math problem?'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'Each test case consists of a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output two positive integers aa and bb, such that a+b=na+b=n and LCM(a,b)LCM(a,b) is the minimum possible.'
