b'A tourist wants to visit country Zeydabad for Zbazi (a local game in Zeydabad).'
b"The country Zeydabad is a rectangular table consisting of n rows and m columns. Each cell on the country is either 'z' or '.'."
b'The tourist knows this country is named Zeydabad because there are lots of \'\'Z-pattern"s in the country. A \'\'Z-pattern" is a square which anti-diagonal is completely filled with \'z\' and its upper and lower rows are also completely filled with \'z\'. All other cells of a square can be arbitrary.'
b'  '
b'Note that a \'\'Z-pattern" can consist of only one cell (see the examples).'
b'So he wants to count the number of \'\'Z-pattern"s in the country (a necessary skill for Zbazi).'
b'Now your task is to help tourist with counting number of \'\'Z-pattern"s.'
b'As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n,\xe2\x80\x89m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns respectively.'
b"Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'z' or '.' \xe2\x80\x94 the description of Zeydabad."
b'Output'
b'Print the only integer a \xe2\x80\x94 the number of \'\'Z-pattern"s in Zeydabad.'
