b'As the name of the task implies, you are asked to do some work with segments and trees.'
b'Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph such that there is exactly one simple path between every pair of its vertices.'
b"You are given nn segments [l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[ln,rn][l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[ln,rn], li<rili<ri for every ii. It is guaranteed that all segments' endpoints are integers, and all endpoints are unique \xe2\x80\x94 there is no pair of segments such that they start in the same point, end in the same point or one starts in the same point the other one ends."
b"Let's generate a graph with nn vertices from these segments. Vertices vv and uu are connected by an edge if and only if segments [lv,rv][lv,rv] and [lu,ru][lu,ru] intersect and neither of it lies fully inside the other one."
b'For example, pairs ([1,3],[2,4])([1,3],[2,4]) and ([5,10],[3,7])([5,10],[3,7]) will induce the edges but pairs ([1,2],[3,4])([1,2],[3,4]) and ([5,7],[3,10])([5,7],[3,10]) will not.'
b'Determine if the resulting graph is a tree or not.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of segments.'
b'The ii-th of the next nn lines contain the description of the ii-th segment \xe2\x80\x94 two integers lili and riri (1\xe2\x89\xa4li<ri\xe2\x89\xa42n1\xe2\x89\xa4li<ri\xe2\x89\xa42n).'
b'It is guaranteed that all segments borders are pairwise distinct. '
b'Output'
b'Print "YES" if the resulting graph is a tree and "NO" otherwise.'
