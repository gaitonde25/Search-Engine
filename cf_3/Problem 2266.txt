b'The coronation of King Berl XXII is soon! The whole royal family, including nn daughters of Berl XXII, will be present.'
b'The King has ordered his jeweler to assemble nn beautiful necklaces, so each of the princesses could wear exactly one necklace during the ceremony \xe2\x80\x94 and now these necklaces are finished. Each necklace consists of mm gems attached to a gold chain. There are two types of gems used in the necklaces \xe2\x80\x94 emeralds and sapphires. So, each necklace can be represented by a sequence of mm gems (listed from left to right), and each gem is either an emerald or a sapphire. Formally, the ii-th necklace can be represented by a binary string sisi of length mm; if the jj-th character of sisi is 0, then the jj-th gem in the ii-th necklace is an emerald; otherwise, this gem is a sapphire.'
b"Now, looking at the necklaces, the King is afraid that some of his daughters may envy the other daughters' necklaces. He wants all necklaces to look similar. Two necklaces are considered similar if there are at least kk positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems."
b'For example, if there is a necklace represented by a sequence 01010111 and a necklace represented by a sequence 01100000, then there are 33 positions where these necklaces contain the same type of gems (both first gems are emeralds, both second gems are sapphires, and both fifth gems are emeralds). So if k=3k=3, these necklaces are similar, and if k=4k=4, they are not similar.'
b"The King thinks that if two of his daughters notice that their necklaces are not similar, then they may have a conflict \xe2\x80\x94 and, obviously, he doesn't want any conflicts during the coronation! So Berl XXII wants to tell some of his daughters to wear their necklaces backward. If a necklace is worn backward, then the sequence of gems in this necklace is reversed. For example, if a necklace is represented by a sequence 01100, then, if worn backward, it would be represented by a sequence 00110. The King wants to find the minimum number of necklaces to be worn backward during the coronation so that there are no conflicts."
b'Berl XXII is too busy with preparation for the coronation, so he ordered you to resolve this issue for him. Help him \xe2\x80\x94 and he will give you a truly royal reward! '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa450) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.'
b'Each test case begins with a line containing three integers nn, mm and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4502\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa450) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of necklaces, the number of gems in each necklace, and the minimum number of positions where two necklaces have to have the same type of gems in order to look similar, respectively.'
b'Then nn lines follow, the ii-th of them contains a binary string sisi of length mm representing the ii-th necklace.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer as follows.'
b'If it is impossible to avoid the conflict, print -1 on a single line. In this case you should not output anything else for that test case.'
b'Otherwise, the first line of the test case answer should contain the single integer dd \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of necklaces that are to be worn backward. The second line of the test case answer should contain the numbers of these necklaces (integers from 11 to nn) in any order. If d=0d=0 then leave the second line of the test case answer empty. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.'
