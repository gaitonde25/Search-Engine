b"Mihai lives in a town where meteor storms are a common problem. It's annoying, because Mihai has to buy groceries sometimes, and getting hit by meteors isn't fun. Therefore, we ask you to find the most dangerous way to buy groceries so that we can trick him to go there."
b'The town has nn buildings numbered from 11 to nn. Some buildings have roads between them, and there is exactly 11 simple path from any building to any other building. Each road has a certain meteor danger level. The buildings all have grocery stores, but Mihai only cares about the open ones, of course. Initially, all the grocery stores are closed.'
b'You are given qq queries of three types:'
b"  Given the integers ll and rr, the buildings numbered from ll to rr open their grocery stores (nothing happens to buildings in the range that already have an open grocery store). Given the integers ll and rr, the buildings numbered from ll to rr close their grocery stores (nothing happens to buildings in the range that didn't have an open grocery store). Given the integer xx, find the maximum meteor danger level on the simple path from xx to any open grocery store, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if there is no edge on any simple path to an open store. "
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the two integers nn and qq (2\xe2\x89\xa4n,q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n,q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Then follows n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines, the ii-th of which containing the integers uiui, vivi, and wiwi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4109) meaning there is two way road between building uiui and vivi with meteor danger level wiwi.'
b'It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'Then follows qq lines, the jj-th of which begin with the integer tjtj (1\xe2\x89\xa4tj\xe2\x89\xa431\xe2\x89\xa4tj\xe2\x89\xa43), meaning the jj-th query is of the tjtj-th type.'
b'If tjtj is 11 or 22 the rest of the line contains the integers ljlj and rjrj (1\xe2\x89\xa4lj\xe2\x89\xa4rj\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4lj\xe2\x89\xa4rj\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'If tjtj is 33 the rest of the line contains the integer xjxj (1\xe2\x89\xa4xj\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xj\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'Output'
b'For each query of the 33rd type (tj=3tj=3), output the maximum meteor danger level that is on some edge on the simple path from xjxj to some open store, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if there is no such edge.'
