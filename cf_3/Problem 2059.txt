b'There are nn lamps on a line, numbered from 11 to nn. Each one has an initial state off (00) or on (11).'
b"You're given kk subsets A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AkA1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ak of {1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n}{1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n}, such that the intersection of any three subsets is empty. In other words, for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i1<i2<i3\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4i1<i2<i3\xe2\x89\xa4k, Ai1\xe2\x88\xa9Ai2\xe2\x88\xa9Ai3=\xe2\x88\x85Ai1\xe2\x88\xa9Ai2\xe2\x88\xa9Ai3=\xe2\x88\x85."
b"In one operation, you can choose one of these kk subsets and switch the state of all lamps in it. It is guaranteed that, with the given subsets, it's possible to make all lamps be simultaneously on using this type of operation."
b'Let mimi be the minimum number of operations you have to do in order to make the ii first lamps be simultaneously on. Note that there is no condition upon the state of other lamps (between i+1i+1 and nn), they can be either off or on.'
b'You have to compute mimi for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'The second line contains a binary string of length nn, representing the initial state of each lamp (the lamp ii is off if si=0si=0, on if si=1si=1).'
b'The description of each one of the kk subsets follows, in the following format:'
b'The first line of the description contains a single integer cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the subset.'
b'The second line of the description contains cc distinct integers x1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xcx1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xc (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the subset.'
b'It is guaranteed that: '
b"  The intersection of any three subsets is empty;  It's possible to make all lamps be simultaneously on using some operations. "
b'Output'
b'You must output nn lines. The ii-th line should contain a single integer mimi \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations required to make the lamps 11 to ii be simultaneously on.'
