b'The final match of the Berland Football Cup has been held recently. The referee has shown nn yellow cards throughout the match. At the beginning of the match there were a1a1 players in the first team and a2a2 players in the second team.'
b"The rules of sending players off the game are a bit different in Berland football. If a player from the first team receives k1k1 yellow cards throughout the match, he can no longer participate in the match \xe2\x80\x94 he's sent off. And if a player from the second team receives k2k2 yellow cards, he's sent off. After a player leaves the match, he can no longer receive any yellow cards. Each of nn yellow cards was shown to exactly one player. Even if all players from one team (or even from both teams) leave the match, the game still continues."
b'The referee has lost his records on who has received each yellow card. Help him to determine the minimum and the maximum number of players that could have been thrown out of the game.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer a1a1 (1\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x89\xa41000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of players in the first team.'
b'The second line contains one integer a2a2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4a2\xe2\x89\xa41000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4a2\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of players in the second team.'
b'The third line contains one integer k1k1 (1\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa41000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of yellow cards a player from the first team can receive (after receiving that many yellow cards, he leaves the game).'
b'The fourth line contains one integer k2k2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4k2\xe2\x89\xa41000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4k2\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of yellow cards a player from the second team can receive (after receiving that many yellow cards, he leaves the game).'
b'The fifth line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x8b\x85k1+a2\xe2\x8b\x85k2)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x8b\x85k1+a2\xe2\x8b\x85k2) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of yellow cards that have been shown during the match.'
b'Output'
b'Print two integers \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum and the maximum number of players that could have been thrown out of the game.'
