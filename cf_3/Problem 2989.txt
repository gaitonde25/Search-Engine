b'Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is planning to go for a famous restaurant \xe2\x80\x94 "Alice\'s".'
b'The restaurant "Alice\'s" serves nn kinds of food. The cost for the ii-th kind is always cici. Initially, the restaurant has enough ingredients for serving exactly aiai dishes of the ii-th kind. In the New Year\'s Eve, mm customers will visit Alice\'s one after another and the jj-th customer will order djdj dishes of the tjtj-th kind of food. The (i+1)(i+1)-st customer will only come after the ii-th customer is completely served.'
b'Suppose there are riri dishes of the ii-th kind remaining (initially ri=airi=ai). When a customer orders 11 dish of the ii-th kind, the following principles will be processed.'
b' If ri>0ri>0, the customer will be served exactly 11 dish of the ii-th kind. The cost for the dish is cici. Meanwhile, riri will be reduced by 11. Otherwise, the customer will be served 11 dish of the cheapest available kind of food if there are any. If there are multiple cheapest kinds of food, the one with the smallest index among the cheapest will be served. The cost will be the cost for the dish served and the remain for the corresponding dish will be reduced by 11. If there are no more dishes at all, the customer will leave angrily. Therefore, no matter how many dishes are served previously, the cost for the customer is 00.'
b"If the customer doesn't leave after the djdj dishes are served, the cost for the customer will be the sum of the cost for these djdj dishes."
b'Please determine the total cost for each of the mm customers.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105), representing the number of different kinds of food and the number of customers, respectively.'
b'The second line contains nn positive integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41071\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4107), where aiai denotes the initial remain of the ii-th kind of dishes.'
b'The third line contains nn positive integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4106), where cici denotes the cost of one dish of the ii-th kind.'
b'The following mm lines describe the orders of the mm customers respectively. The jj-th line contains two positive integers tjtj and djdj (1\xe2\x89\xa4tj\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4tj\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4dj\xe2\x89\xa41071\xe2\x89\xa4dj\xe2\x89\xa4107), representing the kind of food and the number of dishes the jj-th customer orders, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Print mm lines. In the jj-th line print the cost for the jj-th customer.'
