b'You have nn coins, each of the same value of 11.'
b'Distribute them into packets such that any amount xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n) can be formed using some (possibly one or all) number of these packets.'
b"Each packet may only be used entirely or not used at all. No packet may be used more than once in the formation of the single xx, however it may be reused for the formation of other xx's."
b'Find the minimum number of packets in such a distribution.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of coins you have.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible number of packets, satisfying the condition above.'
