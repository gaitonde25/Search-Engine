b'A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. Two binary strings aa and bb of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer ii such that ai=biai=bi). For example:'
b'  10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position 44);  10010 and 11111 are similar;  111 and 111 are similar;  0110 and 1001 are not similar. '
b"You are given an integer nn and a binary string ss consisting of 2n\xe2\x88\x9212n\xe2\x88\x921 characters. Let's denote s[l..r]s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of ss starting with ll-th character and ending with rr-th character (in other words, s[l..r]=slsl+1sl+2\xe2\x80\xa6srs[l..r]=slsl+1sl+2\xe2\x80\xa6sr)."
b'You have to construct a binary string ww of length nn which is similar to all of the following strings: s[1..n]s[1..n], s[2..n+1]s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2]s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n\xe2\x88\x921]s[n..2n\xe2\x88\x921].'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450).'
b'The second line of each test case contains the binary string ss of length 2n\xe2\x88\x9212n\xe2\x88\x921. Each character sisi is either 0 or 1.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the corresponding binary string ww of length nn. If there are multiple such strings \xe2\x80\x94 print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string ww meeting the constraints always exists.'
