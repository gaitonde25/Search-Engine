b'You have decided to open a new school. You have already found nn teachers and mm groups of students. The ii-th group of students consists of ki\xe2\x89\xa52ki\xe2\x89\xa52 students. You know age of each teacher and each student. The ages of teachers are a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an and the ages of students of the ii-th group are bi,1,bi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bi,kibi,1,bi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bi,ki.'
b'To start lessons you should assign the teacher to each group of students. Such assignment should satisfy the following requirements:'
b"  To each group exactly one teacher assigned.  To each teacher at most 11 group of students assigned.  The average of students' ages in each group doesn't exceed the age of the teacher assigned to this group. "
b'The average of set x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xkx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xk of kk integers is x1+x2+\xe2\x80\xa6+xkkx1+x2+\xe2\x80\xa6+xkk.'
b'Recently you have heard that one of the students will refuse to study in your school. After this, the size of one group will decrease by 11 while all other groups will remain unchanged.'
b"You don't know who will refuse to study. For each student determine if you can start lessons in case of his refusal."
b'Note, that it is not guaranteed that it is possible to start lessons before any refusal.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of teachers and the number of groups of students.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the ages of teachers.'
b'The next 2m2m lines contains descriptions of groups. '
b'The first line of description of group contains a single integer kiki (2\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of students in this group. '
b'The second line of description of group contains kiki integers bi,1,bi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bi,kibi,1,bi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bi,ki (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi,j\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4bi,j\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the ages of students of this group.'
b"It is guaranteed that the total sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 105105 and that the total sum of k1+k2+\xe2\x80\xa6+kmk1+k2+\xe2\x80\xa6+km over all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105"
b'Output'
b'For each test case output string of symbols 00 and 11 of length k1+k2+\xe2\x80\xa6+kmk1+k2+\xe2\x80\xa6+km. The ii-th symbol of this string should be equals 11 if it is possible to start lessons in case of the ii-th student refuse and it should be equals 00 otherwise.'
b'Students are numbered by integers from 11 to k1+k2+\xe2\x80\xa6+kmk1+k2+\xe2\x80\xa6+km in the order they appear in the input. Thus, students of the 11-st group are numbered by integers 11, 22, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, k1k1, students of the 22-nd group are numbered by integers k1+1k1+1, k1+2k1+2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, k1+k2k1+k2 and so on.'
