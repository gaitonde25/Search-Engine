b'Eulampius has created a game with the following rules:'
b' there are two players in the game: a human and a computer;  the game lasts for no more than nn rounds. Initially both players have 00 points. In the jj-th round the human gains ajaj points, and the computer gains bjbj points. The points are gained simultaneously; the game ends when one of the players gets kk or more points. This player loses the game. If both players get kk or more points simultaneously, both lose; if both players have less than kk points after nn rounds, the game ends in a tie; after each round the human can push the "Reset" button. If the human had xx points, and the computer had yy points before the button is pushed (of course, x<kx<k and y<ky<k), then after the button is pushed the human will have x\xe2\x80\xb2=max(0,x\xe2\x88\x92y)x\xe2\x80\xb2=max(0,x\xe2\x88\x92y) points, and the computer will have y\xe2\x80\xb2=max(0,y\xe2\x88\x92x)y\xe2\x80\xb2=max(0,y\xe2\x88\x92x) points. E.\xe2\x80\x89g. the push of "Reset" button transforms the state (x=3,y=5)(x=3,y=5) into the state (x\xe2\x80\xb2=0,y\xe2\x80\xb2=2)(x\xe2\x80\xb2=0,y\xe2\x80\xb2=2), and the state (x=8,y=2)(x=8,y=2) into the state (x\xe2\x80\xb2=6,y\xe2\x80\xb2=0)(x\xe2\x80\xb2=6,y\xe2\x80\xb2=0).'
b'Eulampius asked his friend Polycarpus to test the game. Polycarpus has quickly revealed that amounts of points gained by the human and the computer in each of nn rounds are generated before the game and stored in a file. In other words, the pushes of the "Reset" button do not influence the values ajaj and bjbj, so sequences aa and bb are fixed and known in advance.'
b'Polycarpus wants to make a plan for the game. He would like to win the game pushing the "Reset" button as few times as possible. Your task is to determine this minimal number of pushes or determine that Polycarpus cannot win.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible number of rounds in the game and the number of points, after reaching which a player loses, respectively.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4aj<k)1\xe2\x89\xa4aj<k), where ajaj is the amount of points the human gains in the jj-th round.'
b'The third line of each test case contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bj<k1\xe2\x89\xa4bj<k), where bjbj is the amount of points the computer gains in the jj-th round.'
b'The sum of nn over all test cases in the input does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'Print the answers for all test cases in the order they appear in the input.'
b'If Polycarpus cannot win the game, then simply print one line "-1" (without quotes). In this case, you should not output anything else for that test case. Otherwise, the first line of the test case answer should contain one integer dd\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible number of "Reset" button pushes, required to win the game. The next line should contain dd distinct integers r1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rdr1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rd (1\xe2\x89\xa4ri<n1\xe2\x89\xa4ri<n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the numbers of rounds, at the end of which Polycarpus has to press the "Reset" button, in arbitrary order. If d=0d=0 then either leave the second line of the test case answer empty, or do not print the second line at all.'
b'If there are several possible solutions, print any of them.'
