b'Alice has a string ss. She really likes the letter "a". She calls a string good if strictly more than half of the characters in that string are "a"s. For example "aaabb", "axaa" are good strings, and "baca", "awwwa", "" (empty string) are not.'
b'Alice can erase some characters from her string ss. She would like to know what is the longest string remaining after erasing some characters (possibly zero) to get a good string. It is guaranteed that the string has at least one "a" in it, so the answer always exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa450) consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that there is at least one "a" in ss.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer, the length of the longest good string that Alice can get after erasing some characters from ss.'
