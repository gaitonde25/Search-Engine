b'Daniel is watching a football team playing a game during their training session. They want to improve their passing skills during that session.'
b'The game involves nn players, making multiple passes towards each other. Unfortunately, since the balls were moving too fast, after the session Daniel is unable to know how many balls were involved during the game. The only thing he knows is the number of passes delivered by each player during all the session.'
b'Find the minimum possible amount of balls that were involved in the game.'
b'Input'
b'There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description.'
b'The first line of each test case contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of players.'
b'The second line of the test case contains a sequence of integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109), where aiai is the number of passes delivered by the ii-th player.'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the problem.'
