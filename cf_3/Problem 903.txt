b'To satisfy his love of matching socks, Phoenix has brought his nn socks (nn is even) to the sock store. Each of his socks has a color cici and is either a left sock or right sock. '
b'Phoenix can pay one dollar to the sock store to either: '
b'  recolor a sock to any color c\xe2\x80\xb2c\xe2\x80\xb2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4n)(1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4n)  turn a left sock into a right sock  turn a right sock into a left sock '
b' '
b"The sock store may perform each of these changes any number of times. Note that the color of a left sock doesn't change when it turns into a right sock, and vice versa. "
b'A matching pair of socks is a left and right sock with the same color. What is the minimum cost for Phoenix to make n/2n/2 matching pairs? Each sock must be included in exactly one matching pair.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains three integers nn, ll, and rr (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; nn is even; 0\xe2\x89\xa4l,r\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4l,r\xe2\x89\xa4n; l+r=nl+r=n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the total number of socks, and the number of left and right socks, respectively.'
b'The next line contains nn integers cici (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the colors of the socks. The first ll socks are left socks, while the next rr socks are right socks.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn across all the test cases will not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum cost for Phoenix to make n/2n/2 matching pairs. Each sock must be included in exactly one matching pair.'
