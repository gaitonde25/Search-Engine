b'You are given an undirected unweighted tree consisting of nn vertices.'
b'An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 edges.'
b'Your task is to choose two pairs of vertices of this tree (all the chosen vertices should be distinct) (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) in such a way that neither x1x1 nor y1y1 belong to the simple path from x2x2 to y2y2 and vice versa (neither x2x2 nor y2y2 should not belong to the simple path from x1x1 to y1y1).'
b'It is guaranteed that it is possible to choose such pairs for the given tree.'
b'Among all possible ways to choose such pairs you have to choose one with the maximum number of common vertices between paths from x1x1 to y1y1 and from x2x2 to y2y2. And among all such pairs you have to choose one with the maximum total length of these two paths.'
b'It is guaranteed that the answer with at least two common vertices exists for the given tree.'
b'The length of the path is the number of edges in it.'
b'The simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer nn \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree (6\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851056\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describes the edges of the tree.'
b'Edge ii is denoted by two integers uiui and vivi, the labels of vertices it connects (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi).'
b'It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'It is guaranteed that the answer with at least two common vertices exists for the given tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print any two pairs of vertices satisfying the conditions described in the problem statement.'
b'It is guaranteed that it is possible to choose such pairs for the given tree.'
