b"You are given nn dominoes. Each domino has a left and a right cell. Each cell can be colored either black or white. Some cells are already colored, while some aren't yet."
b'The coloring is said to be valid if and only if it is possible to rearrange the dominoes in some order such that for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n the color of the right cell of the ii-th domino is different from the color of the left cell of the ((imodn)+1)((imodn)+1)-st domino. '
b"Note that you can't rotate the dominoes, so the left cell always remains the left cell, and the right cell always remains the right cell."
b'Count the number of valid ways to color the yet uncolored cells of dominoes. Two ways are considered different if there is a cell that is colored white in one way and black in the other. In particular, colorings BW WB and WB BW different (and both invalid).'
b'As this number can be very big, output it modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of dominoes.'
b'The next nn lines describe dominoes. Each line contains two characters which represent the left and the right cell. Character B means that the corresponding cell is black, character W means that the corresponding cell is white, and ? means that the cell is yet to be colored. '
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the problem.'
