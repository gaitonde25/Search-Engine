b'A pair (x,y)(x,y) such that x<yx<y is ambiguous if day xx of month yy is the same day of the week as day yy of month xx.'
b'Count the number of ambiguous pairs.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'Each of the next tt lines contains three integers mm, dd and ww (1\xe2\x89\xa4m,d,w\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4m,d,w\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of months in a year, the number of days in a month and the number of days in a week.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 for each testcase output the number of pairs (x,y)(x,y) such that x<yx<y and day xx of month yy is the same day of the week as day yy of month xx.'
