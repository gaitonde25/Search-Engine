b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'This is an easy version of the problem. The difference from the hard version is that in the easy version t=1t=1 and the number of queries is limited to 2020.'
b'Polycarp is playing a computer game. In this game, an array consisting of zeros and ones is hidden. Polycarp wins if he guesses the position of the kk-th zero from the left tt times.'
b'Polycarp can make no more than 2020 requests of the following type: '
b'  ? ll rr\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 find out the sum of all elements in positions from ll to rr (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n) inclusive. '
b"In this (easy version) of the problem, this paragraph doesn't really make sense since t=1t=1 always. To make the game more interesting, each guessed zero turns into one and the game continues on the changed array. More formally, if the position of the kk-th zero was xx, then after Polycarp guesses this position, the xx-th element of the array will be replaced from 00 to 11. Of course, this feature affects something only for t>1t>1."
b'Help Polycarp win the game.'
