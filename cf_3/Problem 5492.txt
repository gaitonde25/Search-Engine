b'A number is called quasibinary if its decimal representation contains only digits 0 or 1. For example, numbers 0, 1, 101, 110011\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 are quasibinary and numbers 2, 12, 900 are not.'
b'You are given a positive integer n. Represent it as a sum of minimum number of quasibinary numbers.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89106).'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print a single integer k\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of numbers in the representation of number n as a sum of quasibinary numbers.'
b"In the second line print k numbers \xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the sum. All these numbers should be quasibinary according to the definition above, their sum should equal n. Do not have to print the leading zeroes in the numbers. The order of numbers doesn't matter. If there are multiple possible representations, you are allowed to print any of them."
