b'You have a rectangular chocolate bar consisting of n\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89m single squares. You want to eat exactly k squares, so you may need to break the chocolate bar. '
b'In one move you can break any single rectangular piece of chocolate in two rectangular pieces. You can break only by lines between squares: horizontally or vertically. The cost of breaking is equal to square of the break length.'
b'For example, if you have a chocolate bar consisting of 2\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x893 unit squares then you can break it horizontally and get two 1\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x893 pieces (the cost of such breaking is 32\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x899), or you can break it vertically in two ways and get two pieces: 2\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x891 and 2\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x892 (the cost of such breaking is 22\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x894).'
b'For several given values n, m and k find the minimum total cost of breaking. You can eat exactly k squares of chocolate if after all operations of breaking there is a set of rectangular pieces of chocolate with the total size equal to k squares. The remaining n\xc2\xb7m\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89k squares are not necessarily form a single rectangular piece.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89t\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8940910)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of values n, m and k to process.'
b'Each of the next t lines contains three integers n, m and k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8930,\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89min(n\xc2\xb7m,\xe2\x80\x8950))\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the dimensions of the chocolate bar and the number of squares you want to eat respectively.'
b'Output'
b'For each n, m and k print the minimum total cost needed to break the chocolate bar, in order to make it possible to eat exactly k squares.'
