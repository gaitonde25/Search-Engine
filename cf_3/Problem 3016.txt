b'Ivan loves burgers and spending money. There are nn burger joints on the street where Ivan lives. Ivan has qq friends, and the ii-th friend suggested to meet at the joint lili and walk to the joint riri (li\xe2\x89\xa4ri)(li\xe2\x89\xa4ri). While strolling with the ii-th friend Ivan can visit all joints xx which satisfy li\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4rili\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4ri.'
b'For each joint Ivan knows the cost of the most expensive burger in it, it costs cici burles. Ivan wants to visit some subset of joints on his way, in each of them he will buy the most expensive burger and spend the most money. But there is a small issue: his card broke and instead of charging him for purchases, the amount of money on it changes as follows.'
b'If Ivan had dd burles before the purchase and he spent cc burles at the joint, then after the purchase he would have d\xe2\x8a\x95cd\xe2\x8a\x95c burles, where \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.'
b'Currently Ivan has 22100\xe2\x88\x92122100\xe2\x88\x921 burles and he wants to go out for a walk. Help him to determine the maximal amount of burles he can spend if he goes for a walk with the friend ii. The amount of burles he spends is defined as the difference between the initial amount on his account and the final account.'
