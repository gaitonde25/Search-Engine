b'Nauuo is a girl who loves playing cards.'
b'One day she was playing cards but found that the cards were mixed with some empty ones.'
b"There are nn cards numbered from 11 to nn, and they were mixed with another nn empty cards. She piled up the 2n2n cards and drew nn of them. The nn cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining nn cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom."
b'In one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it \xe2\x80\x94 put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile.'
b'Nauuo wants to make the nn numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the ii-th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card ii) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of numbered cards.'
b"The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the initial cards in Nauuo's hands. 00 represents an empty card."
b'The third line contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the initial cards in the pile, given in order from top to bottom. 00 represents an empty card.'
b'It is guaranteed that each number from 11 to nn appears exactly once, either in a1..na1..n or b1..nb1..n.'
b'Output'
b'The output contains a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations to make the nn numbered cards piled up in increasing order.'
