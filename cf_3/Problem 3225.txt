b'There is a strip with an infinite number of cells. Cells are numbered starting with 00. Initially the cell ii contains a ball with the number ii.'
b'There are nn pockets located at cells a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. Each cell contains at most one pocket.'
b'Filtering is the following sequence of operations:'
b' All pockets at cells a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an open simultaneously, which makes balls currently located at those cells disappear. After the balls disappear, the pockets close again. For each cell ii from 00 to \xe2\x88\x9e\xe2\x88\x9e, if the cell ii contains a ball, we move that ball to the free cell jj with the lowest number. If there is no free cell j<ij<i, the ball stays at the cell ii.'
b'Note that after each filtering operation each cell will still contain exactly one ball.'
b'For example, let the cells 11, 33 and 44 contain pockets. The initial configuration of balls is shown below (underscores display the cells with pockets):'
b' 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... '
b'After opening and closing the pockets, balls 1, 3 and 4 disappear:'
b' 0 \xc2\xa0 2 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 5 6 7 8 9 ... '
b'After moving all the balls to the left, the configuration looks like this:'
b' 0 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ... '
b'Another filtering repetition results in the following:'
b' 0 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ... '
b'You have to answer mm questions. The ii-th of these questions is "what is the number of the ball located at the cell xixi after kiki repetitions of the filtering operation?"'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of pockets and questions respectively (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The following line contains nn integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the numbers of cells containing pockets (0\xe2\x89\xa4a1<\xe2\x80\xa6<an\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4a1<\xe2\x80\xa6<an\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The following mm lines describe questions. The ii-th of these lines contains two integers xixi and kiki (0\xe2\x89\xa4xi,ki\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4xi,ki\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b'Print mm numbers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 answers to the questions, in the same order as given in the input.'
