b'You are playing a computer card game called Splay the Sire. Currently you are struggling to defeat the final boss of the game.'
b"The boss battle consists of nn turns. During each turn, you will get several cards. Each card has two parameters: its cost cici and damage didi. You may play some of your cards during each turn in some sequence (you choose the cards and the exact order they are played), as long as the total cost of the cards you play during the turn does not exceed 33. After playing some (possibly zero) cards, you end your turn, and all cards you didn't play are discarded. Note that you can use each card at most once."
b'Your character has also found an artifact that boosts the damage of some of your actions: every 1010-th card you play deals double damage.'
b'What is the maximum possible damage you can deal during nn turns?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of turns.'
b'Then nn blocks of input follow, the ii-th block representing the cards you get during the ii-th turn.'
b'Each block begins with a line containing one integer kiki (1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cards you get during ii-th turn. Then kiki lines follow, each containing two integers cjcj and djdj (1\xe2\x89\xa4cj\xe2\x89\xa431\xe2\x89\xa4cj\xe2\x89\xa43, 1\xe2\x89\xa4dj\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4dj\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the parameters of the corresponding card.'
b'It is guaranteed that \xe2\x88\x91i=1nki\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\xe2\x88\x91i=1nki\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum damage you may deal.'
