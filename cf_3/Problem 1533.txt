b'A binary matrix is called good if every even length square sub-matrix has an odd number of ones. '
b'Given a binary matrix aa consisting of nn rows and mm columns, determine the minimum number of cells you need to change to make it good, or report that there is no way to make it good at all. '
b'All the terms above have their usual meanings\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 refer to the Notes section for their formal definitions. '
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4106 and n\xe2\x8b\x85m\xe2\x89\xa4106n\xe2\x8b\x85m\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns in aa, respectively. '
b'The following nn lines each contain mm characters, each of which is one of 0 and 1. If the jj-th character on the ii-th line is 1, then ai,j=1ai,j=1. Similarly, if the jj-th character on the ii-th line is 0, then ai,j=0ai,j=0.'
b'Output'
b"Output the minimum number of cells you need to change to make aa good, or output \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it's not possible at all."
