b"You have rr red and bb blue beans. You'd like to distribute them among several (maybe, one) packets in such a way that each packet: "
b'  has at least one red bean (or the number of red beans ri\xe2\x89\xa51ri\xe2\x89\xa51);  has at least one blue bean (or the number of blue beans bi\xe2\x89\xa51bi\xe2\x89\xa51);  the number of red and blue beans should differ in no more than dd (or |ri\xe2\x88\x92bi|\xe2\x89\xa4d|ri\xe2\x88\x92bi|\xe2\x89\xa4d) '
b'Can you distribute all beans?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first and only line of each test case contains three integers rr, bb, and dd (1\xe2\x89\xa4r,b\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4r,b\xe2\x89\xa4109; 0\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of red and blue beans and the maximum absolute difference in each packet.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, if you can distribute all beans, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.'
b'You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES are all recognized as positive answer).'
