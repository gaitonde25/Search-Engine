b'Note that the memory limit is unusual.'
b'You are given a multiset consisting of nn integers. You have to process queries of two types:'
b'  add integer kk into the multiset;  find the kk-th order statistics in the multiset and remove it. '
b'kk-th order statistics in the multiset is the kk-th element in the sorted list of all elements of the multiset. For example, if the multiset contains elements 11, 44, 22, 11, 44, 55, 77, and k=3k=3, then you have to find the 33-rd element in [1,1,2,4,4,5,7][1,1,2,4,4,5,7], which is 22. If you try to delete an element which occurs multiple times in the multiset, only one occurence is removed. '
b'After processing all queries, print any number belonging to the multiset, or say that it is empty.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,q\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n,q\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the initial multiset and the number of queries, respectively.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x89\xa4a2\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x8b\xaf\xe2\x89\xa4an\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x89\xa4a2\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x8b\xaf\xe2\x89\xa4an\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the multiset.'
b'The third line contains qq integers k1k1, k2k2, ..., kqkq, each representing a query: '
b'  if 1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa4n, then the ii-th query is "insert kiki into the multiset";  if ki<0ki<0, then the ii-th query is "remove the |ki||ki|-th order statistics from the multiset". For this query, it is guaranteed that |ki||ki| is not greater than the size of the multiset. '
b'Output'
b'If the multiset is empty after all queries, print 00.'
b'Otherwise, print any integer that belongs to the resulting multiset.'
