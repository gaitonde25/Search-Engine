b'Do you know what tubular bells are? They are a musical instrument made up of cylindrical metal tubes. In an orchestra, tubular bells are used to mimic the ringing of bells.'
b'Mike has tubular bells, too! They consist of nn tubes, and each of the tubes has a length that can be expressed by a integer from ll to rr inclusive. It is clear that the lengths of all the tubes are different (it makes no sense to make the same tubes). It is also known that r\xe2\x88\x92l+1=nr\xe2\x88\x92l+1=n.'
b"Formally, we can say that Mike's tubular bells are described by a permutation aa of length nn that contains all numbers from ll to rr inclusive, with aiai denoting the length of the ii-th tube."
b"You are offered an interesting task: to guess what Mike's instrument looks like. Simply, you must guess the permutation."
b"Mike won't tell you ll or rr. He will only tell you nn, and will allow you to ask no more than n+5000n+5000 queries."
b'In each query, you name two positive integers xx, yy such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n,x\xe2\x89\xa0y1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n,x\xe2\x89\xa0y. In response to this query, the program written by Mike will give you lcm(ax,ay)lcm(ax,ay), where lcm(c,d)lcm(c,d) denotes the least common multiple of cc and dd.'
b"Solve Mike's problem!"
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases.'
b'The first line contains one positive integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4201\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa420), denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b"The single line of each test case contains one positive integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of tubes in Mike's tubular bells. Also 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, i.e. the lengths of the tubes do not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of maximal number of queries (i.e. n+5000n+5000) over all test cases does not exceed 105+5000105+5000. It means that sum of nn does not exceed 105+5000\xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x8b\x855000105+5000\xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x8b\x855000.'
