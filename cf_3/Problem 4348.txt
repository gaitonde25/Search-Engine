b'Polycarp invited all his friends to the tea party to celebrate the holiday. He has n cups, one for each of his n friends, with volumes a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an. His teapot stores w milliliters of tea (w\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89a2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89...\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89an). Polycarp wants to pour tea in cups in such a way that:'
b'  Every cup will contain tea for at least half of its volume  Every cup will contain integer number of milliliters of tea  All the tea from the teapot will be poured into cups  All friends will be satisfied. '
b"Friend with cup i won't be satisfied, if there exists such cup j that cup i contains less tea than cup j but ai\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89aj."
b"For each cup output how many milliliters of tea should be poured in it. If it's impossible to pour all the tea and satisfy all conditions then output -1."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integer numbers n and w (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100, ).'
b'The second line contains n numbers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100).'
