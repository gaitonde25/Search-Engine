b'Gildong has bought a famous painting software cfpaint. The working screen of cfpaint is square-shaped consisting of nn rows and nn columns of square cells. The rows are numbered from 11 to nn, from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 11 to nn, from left to right. The position of a cell at row rr and column cc is represented as (r,c)(r,c). There are only two colors for the cells in cfpaint \xe2\x80\x94 black and white.'
b'There is a tool named eraser in cfpaint. The eraser has an integer size kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n). To use the eraser, Gildong needs to click on a cell (i,j)(i,j) where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92k+11\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92k+1. When a cell (i,j)(i,j) is clicked, all of the cells (i\xe2\x80\xb2,j\xe2\x80\xb2)(i\xe2\x80\xb2,j\xe2\x80\xb2) where i\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4i+k\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4i+k\xe2\x88\x921 and j\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4j+k\xe2\x88\x921j\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4j+k\xe2\x88\x921 become white. In other words, a square with side equal to kk cells and top left corner at (i,j)(i,j) is colored white.'
b'A white line is a row or a column without any black cells.'
b'Gildong has worked with cfpaint for some time, so some of the cells (possibly zero or all) are currently black. He wants to know the maximum number of white lines after using the eraser exactly once. Help Gildong find the answer to his question.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns, and the size of the eraser.'
b"The next nn lines contain nn characters each without spaces. The jj-th character in the ii-th line represents the cell at (i,j)(i,j). Each character is given as either 'B' representing a black cell, or 'W' representing a white cell."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer: the maximum number of white lines after using the eraser exactly once.'
