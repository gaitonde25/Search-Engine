b"Since next season are coming, you'd like to form a team from two or three participants. There are nn candidates, the ii-th candidate has rank aiai. But you have weird requirements for your teammates: if you have rank vv and have chosen the ii-th and jj-th candidate, then GCD(v,ai)=XGCD(v,ai)=X and LCM(v,aj)=YLCM(v,aj)=Y must be met."
b'You are very experienced, so you can change your rank to any non-negative integer but XX and YY are tied with your birthdate, so they are fixed.'
b"Now you want to know, how many are there pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that there exists an integer vv meeting the following constraints: GCD(v,ai)=XGCD(v,ai)=X and LCM(v,aj)=YLCM(v,aj)=Y. It's possible that i=ji=j and you form a team of two."
b'GCDGCD is the greatest common divisor of two number, LCMLCM \xe2\x80\x94 the least common multiple.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains three integers nn, XX and YY (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa41018) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candidates and corresponding constants.'

b'Output'
b"Print the only integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that there exists an integer vv meeting the following constraints: GCD(v,ai)=XGCD(v,ai)=X and LCM(v,aj)=YLCM(v,aj)=Y. It's possible that i=ji=j."
