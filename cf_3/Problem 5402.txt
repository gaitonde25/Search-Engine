b'Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases: '
b'  They are equal.  If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct:   a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2  a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1  '
b'As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.'
b"Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!"
b'Input'
b'The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200\xe2\x80\x89000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.'
b'Output'
b'Print "YES" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.'
