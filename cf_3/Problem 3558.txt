b'After passing a test, Vasya got himself a box of nn candies. He decided to eat an equal amount of candies each morning until there are no more candies. However, Petya also noticed the box and decided to get some candies for himself.'
b'This means the process of eating candies is the following: in the beginning Vasya chooses a single integer kk, same for all days. After that, in the morning he eats kk candies from the box (if there are less than kk candies in the box, he eats them all), then in the evening Petya eats 10%10% of the candies remaining in the box. If there are still candies left in the box, the process repeats\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 next day Vasya eats kk candies again, and Petya\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 10%10% of the candies left in a box, and so on.'
b"If the amount of candies in the box is not divisible by 1010, Petya rounds the amount he takes from the box down. For example, if there were 9797 candies in the box, Petya would eat only 99 of them. In particular, if there are less than 1010 candies in a box, Petya won't eat any at all."
b'Your task is to find out the minimal amount of kk that can be chosen by Vasya so that he would eat at least half of the nn candies he initially got. Note that the number kk must be integer.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41018)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial amount of candies in the box.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimal amount of kk that would allow Vasya to eat at least half of candies he got.'
