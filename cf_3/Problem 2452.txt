b"Airports often use moving walkways to help you walking big distances faster. Each such walkway has some speed that effectively increases your speed. You can stand on such a walkway and let it move you, or you could also walk and then your effective speed is your walking speed plus walkway's speed."
b'Limak wants to get from point 00 to point LL on a straight line. There are nn disjoint walkways in between. The ii-th walkway is described by two integers xixi and yiyi and a real value sisi. The ii-th walkway starts at xixi, ends at yiyi and has speed sisi. '
b'Every walkway is located inside the segment [0,L][0,L] and no two walkways have positive intersection. However, they can touch by endpoints.'
b'Limak needs to decide how to distribute his energy. For example, it might make more sense to stand somewhere (or to walk slowly) to then have a lot of energy to walk faster.'
b"Limak's initial energy is 00 and it must never drop below that value. At any moment, he can walk with any speed vv in the interval [0,2][0,2] and it will cost him vv energy per second, but he continuously recovers energy with speed of 11 energy per second. So, when he walks with speed vv, his energy increases by (1\xe2\x88\x92v)(1\xe2\x88\x92v). Note that negative value would mean losing energy."
b"In particular, he can walk with speed 11 and this won't change his energy at all, while walking with speed 0.770.77 effectively gives him 0.230.23 energy per second."
b'Limak can choose his speed arbitrarily (any real value in interval [0,2][0,2]) at every moment of time (including the moments when he is located on non-integer positions). Everything is continuous (non-discrete).'
b'What is the fastest time Limak can get from 00 to LL?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integers nn and LL (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4109), the number of walkways and the distance to walk.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains integers xixi, yiyi and real value sisi (0\xe2\x89\xa4xi<yi\xe2\x89\xa4L0\xe2\x89\xa4xi<yi\xe2\x89\xa4L, 0.1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa410.00.1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa410.0). The value sisi is given with at most 99 digits after decimal point.'
b"It's guaranteed, that no two walkways have a positive intersection. The walkways are listed from left to right. That is, yi\xe2\x89\xa4xi+1yi\xe2\x89\xa4xi+1 for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921."
b'Output'
b"Print one real value, the fastest possible time to reach LL. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error won't exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92910\xe2\x88\x929."
