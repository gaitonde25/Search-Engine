b'If an integer a is divisible by another integer b, then b is called the divisor of a.'
b'For example: 12 has positive 6 divisors. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.'
b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s define a function D(n) \xe2\x80\x94 number of integers between 1 and n (inclusive) which has exactly four positive divisors.'
b'Between 1 and 10 only the integers 6, 8 and 10 has exactly four positive divisors. So, D(10)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893.'
b'You are given an integer n. You have to calculate D(n).'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891011) \xe2\x80\x94 the parameter from the problem statement.'
b'Output'
b'Print the only integer c \xe2\x80\x94 the number of integers between 1 and n with exactly four divisors.'
