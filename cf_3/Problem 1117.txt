b'At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.'
b"Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, aa boys and bb girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs."
b'Formally, you know kk possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.'
b"For example, if a=3a=3, b=4b=4, k=4k=4 and the couples (1,2)(1,2), (1,3)(1,3), (2,2)(2,2), (3,4)(3,4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): "
b'  (1,3)(1,3) and (2,2)(2,2);  (3,4)(3,4) and (1,3)(1,3); '
b'But the following combinations are not possible: '
b'  (1,3)(1,3) and (1,2)(1,2)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the first boy enters two pairs;  (1,2)(1,2) and (2,2)(2,2)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the second girl enters two pairs; '
b'Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains three integers aa, bb and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.'
b'The second line of each test case contains kk integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6aka1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6ak. (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4a1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4a), where aiai is the number of the boy in the pair with the number ii.'
b'The third line of each test case contains kk integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6bkb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6bk. (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4b1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4b), where bibi is the number of the girl in the pair with the number ii.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sums of aa, bb, and kk over all test cases do not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, on a separate line print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.'
