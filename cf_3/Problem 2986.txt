b'Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is going to receive some red envelopes with countless money! But collecting money from red envelopes is a time-consuming process itself.'
b"Let's describe this problem in a mathematical way. Consider a timeline from time 11 to nn. The ii-th red envelope will be available from time sisi to titi, inclusive, and contain wiwi coins. If Bob chooses to collect the coins in the ii-th red envelope, he can do it only in an integer point of time between sisi and titi, inclusive, and he can't collect any more envelopes until time didi (inclusive) after that. Here si\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4disi\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4di holds."
b'Bob is a greedy man, he collects coins greedily \xe2\x80\x94 whenever he can collect coins at some integer time xx, he collects the available red envelope with the maximum number of coins. If there are multiple envelopes with the same maximum number of coins, Bob would choose the one whose parameter dd is the largest. If there are still multiple choices, Bob will choose one from them randomly.'
b"However, Alice \xe2\x80\x94 his daughter \xe2\x80\x94 doesn't want her father to get too many coins. She could disturb Bob at no more than mm integer time moments. If Alice decides to disturb Bob at time xx, he could not do anything at time xx and resumes his usual strategy at the time x+1x+1 (inclusive), which may lead to missing some red envelopes."
b'Calculate the minimum number of coins Bob would get if Alice disturbs him optimally.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three non-negative integers nn, mm and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42000\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4200, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4105), denoting the length of the timeline, the number of times Alice can disturb Bob and the total number of red envelopes, respectively.'
b'The following kk lines describe those kk red envelopes. The ii-th line contains four positive integers sisi, titi, didi and wiwi (1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the time segment when the ii-th envelope is available, the time moment Bob can continue collecting after collecting the ii-th envelope, and the number of coins in this envelope, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Output one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of coins Bob would get if Alice disturbs him optimally.'
