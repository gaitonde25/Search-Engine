b'Alice and Bob are playing a game with nn piles of stones. It is guaranteed that nn is an even number. The ii-th pile has aiai stones.'
b'Alice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.'
b"On a player's turn, they must choose exactly n2n2 nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than n2n2 nonempty piles)."
b'Given the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4502\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of piles. It is guaranteed that nn is an even number.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa450)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of stones in the piles.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single string "Alice" if Alice wins; otherwise, print "Bob" (without double quotes).'
