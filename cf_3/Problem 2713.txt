b'Kuro has just learned about permutations and he is really excited to create a new permutation type. He has chosen nn distinct positive integers and put all of them in a set SS. Now he defines a magical permutation to be:'
b' A permutation of integers from 00 to 2x\xe2\x88\x9212x\xe2\x88\x921, where xx is a non-negative integer.  The bitwise xor of any two consecutive elements in the permutation is an element in SS.'
b'Since Kuro is really excited about magical permutations, he wants to create the longest magical permutation possible. In other words, he wants to find the largest non-negative integer xx such that there is a magical permutation of integers from 00 to 2x\xe2\x88\x9212x\xe2\x88\x921. Since he is a newbie in the subject, he wants you to help him find this value of xx and also the magical permutation for that xx.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the set SS.'
b'The next line contains nn distinct integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SnS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Sn (1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements in the set SS.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print the largest non-negative integer xx, such that there is a magical permutation of integers from 00 to 2x\xe2\x88\x9212x\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Then print 2x2x integers describing a magical permutation of integers from 00 to 2x\xe2\x88\x9212x\xe2\x88\x921. If there are multiple such magical permutations, print any of them.'
