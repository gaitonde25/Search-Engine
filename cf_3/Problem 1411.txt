b" \xe2\x80\x94 Hey folks, how do you like this problem?\xe2\x80\x94 That'll do it. "
b'BThero is a powerful magician. He has got nn piles of candies, the ii-th pile initially contains aiai candies. BThero can cast a copy-paste spell as follows: '
b'  He chooses two piles (i,j)(i,j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n and i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j.  All candies from pile ii are copied into pile jj. Formally, the operation aj:=aj+aiaj:=aj+ai is performed. '
b'BThero can cast this spell any number of times he wants to \xe2\x80\x94 but unfortunately, if some pile contains strictly more than kk candies, he loses his magic power. What is the maximum number of times BThero can cast the spell without losing his power?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines: '
b'  the first line contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000, 2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41042\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4104);  the second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4k). '
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 10001000, and the sum of kk over all test cases does not exceed 104104.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of times BThero can cast the spell without losing his magic power.'
