b'Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.'
b'Neko has two integers aa and bb. His goal is to find a non-negative integer kk such that the least common multiple of a+ka+k and b+kb+k is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers kk, he needs to choose the smallest one.'
b'Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains two integers aa and bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b'Print the smallest non-negative integer kk (k\xe2\x89\xa50k\xe2\x89\xa50) such that the lowest common multiple of a+ka+k and b+kb+k is the smallest possible.'
b'If there are many possible integers kk giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.'
