b'You are given a string s=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sns=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sn of length nn, which only contains digits 11, 22, ..., 99.'
b'A substring s[l\xe2\x80\xa6r]s[l\xe2\x80\xa6r] of ss is a string slsl+1sl+2\xe2\x80\xa6srslsl+1sl+2\xe2\x80\xa6sr. A substring s[l\xe2\x80\xa6r]s[l\xe2\x80\xa6r] of ss is called even if the number represented by it is even. '
b'Find the number of even substrings of ss. Note, that even if some substrings are equal as strings, but have different ll and rr, they are counted as different substrings.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4650001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa465000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string ss.'
b'The second line contains a string ss of length nn. The string ss consists only of digits 11, 22, ..., 99.'
b'Output'
b'Print the number of even substrings of ss.'
