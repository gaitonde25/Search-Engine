b"A lot of frogs want to cross a river. A river is ww units width, but frogs can only jump ll units long, where l<wl<w. Frogs can also jump on lengths shorter than ll. but can't jump longer. Hopefully, there are some stones in the river to help them."
b'The stones are located at integer distances from the banks. There are aiai stones at the distance of ii units from the bank the frogs are currently at. Each stone can only be used once by one frog, after that it drowns in the water.'
b'What is the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river, given that then can only jump on the stones?'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains two integers ww and ll (1\xe2\x89\xa4l<w\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4l<w\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the width of the river and the maximum length of a frog's jump."
b'The second line contains w\xe2\x88\x921w\xe2\x88\x921 integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aw\xe2\x88\x921a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aw\xe2\x88\x921 (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41040\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104), where aiai is the number of stones at the distance ii from the bank the frogs are currently at.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river.'
