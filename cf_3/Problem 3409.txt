b'There is a strange peculiarity: if you connect the cities of Rostov, Taganrog and Shakhty, peculiarly, you get a triangle\xc2\xabUnbelievable But True\xc2\xbb'
b'Students from many different parts of Russia and abroad come to Summer Informatics School. You marked the hometowns of the SIS participants on a map.'
b'Now you decided to prepare an interesting infographic based on this map. The first thing you chose to do is to find three cities on this map, such that they form a triangle with area SS.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains two integers nn and SS (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x8510181\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851018)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities on the map and the area of the triangle to be found.'
b'The next nn lines contain descriptions of the cities, one per line. Each city is described by its integer coordinates xixi, yiyi (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109). '
b'It is guaranteed that all cities are located at distinct points. It is also guaranteed that no three cities lie on the same line.'
b'Output'
b"If the solution doesn't exist\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 print \xc2\xabNo\xc2\xbb."
b'Otherwise, print \xc2\xabYes\xc2\xbb, followed by three pairs of coordinates (x,y)(x,y)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the locations of the three cities, which form the triangle of area SS.'
