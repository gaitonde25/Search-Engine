b'There are n cities in Bearland, numbered 1 through n. Cities are arranged in one long row. The distance between cities i and j is equal to |i\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89j|.'
b"Limak is a police officer. He lives in a city a. His job is to catch criminals. It's hard because he doesn't know in which cities criminals are. Though, he knows that there is at most one criminal in each city."

b'You know in which cities criminals are. Count the number of criminals Limak will catch, after he uses the BCD.'
