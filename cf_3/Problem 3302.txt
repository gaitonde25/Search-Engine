b'You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers. You can perform the following operations with it: '
b'  Choose some positions ii and jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n,i\xe2\x89\xa0j1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n,i\xe2\x89\xa0j), write the value of ai\xe2\x8b\x85ajai\xe2\x8b\x85aj into the jj-th cell and remove the number from the ii-th cell;  Choose some position ii and remove the number from the ii-th cell (this operation can be performed no more than once and at any point of time, not necessarily in the beginning). '
b"The number of elements decreases by one after each operation. However, the indexing of positions stays the same. Deleted numbers can't be used in the later operations."
b'Your task is to perform exactly n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 operations with the array in such a way that the only number that remains in the array is maximum possible. This number can be rather large, so instead of printing it you need to print any sequence of operations which leads to this maximum number. Read the output format to understand what exactly you need to print.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the array.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array.'
b'Output'
b'Print n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines. The kk-th line should contain one of the two possible operations.'
b'The operation of the first type should look like this: 1\xc2\xa0ik\xc2\xa0jk1\xc2\xa0ik\xc2\xa0jk, where 11 is the type of operation, ikik and jkjk are the positions of the chosen elements.'
b'The operation of the second type should look like this: 2\xc2\xa0ik2\xc2\xa0ik, where 22 is the type of operation, ikik is the position of the chosen element. Note that there should be no more than one such operation.'
b'If there are multiple possible sequences of operations leading to the maximum number \xe2\x80\x94 print any of them.'
