b'The new pedestrian zone in Moscow city center consists of nn squares connected with each other by n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 footpaths. We define a simple path as a sequence of squares such that no square appears in this sequence twice and any two adjacent squares in this sequence are directly connected with a footpath. The size of a simple path is the number of squares in it. The footpaths are designed in a such a way that there is exactly one simple path between any pair of different squares.'
b'During preparations for Moscow City Day the city council decided to renew ground tiles on all nn squares. There are kk tile types of different colors, numbered from 11 to kk. For each square exactly one tile type must be selected and then used to cover this square surface. To make walking through the city center more fascinating, it was decided to select tiles types for each square in such a way that any possible simple path of size exactly kk contains squares with all kk possible tile colors.'
b'You need to find out whether it is possible to place the tiles this way or not.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn, kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000002\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of squares in the new pedestrian zone, the number of different tile colors.'
b'Each of the following n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers vivi and uiui (1\xe2\x89\xa4vi,ui\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi,ui\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 numbers of the squares connected by the corresponding road.'
b"It's guaranteed, that it's possible to go from any square to any other square, moreover there is exactly one such simple path."
b'Output'
b'Print "Yes" if it is possible to assign tile colors this way and "No" otherwise.'
b'In case your answer is "Yes", print nn integers from 11 to kk each, the color of the tile for every square.'
