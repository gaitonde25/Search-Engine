b'You are given n points on the straight line \xe2\x80\x94 the positions (x-coordinates) of the cities and m points on the same line \xe2\x80\x94 the positions (x-coordinates) of the cellular towers. All towers work in the same way \xe2\x80\x94 they provide cellular network for all cities, which are located at the distance which is no more than r from this tower.'
b'Your task is to find minimal r that each city has been provided by cellular network, i.e. for each city there is at least one cellular tower at the distance which is no more than r.'
b'If r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890 then a tower provides cellular network only for the point where it is located. One tower can provide cellular network for any number of cities, but all these cities must be at the distance which is no more than r from this tower.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities and the number of cellular towers.'
b'The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89109\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109) \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of cities. It is allowed that there are any number of cities in the same point. All coordinates ai are given in non-decreasing order.'
b'The third line contains a sequence of m integers b1,\xe2\x80\x89b2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89bm (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89109\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89bj\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109) \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of cellular towers.

b'Output'
b'Print minimal r so that each city will be covered by cellular network.'
