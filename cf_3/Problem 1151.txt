b'You want to build a fence that will consist of nn equal sections. All sections have a width equal to 11 and height equal to kk. You will place all sections in one line side by side.'
b'Unfortunately, the ground beneath the fence is not flat. For simplicity, you can think that the ground level under the ii-th section is equal to hihi. '
b'You should follow several rules to build the fence: '
b'  the consecutive sections should have a common side of length at least 11;  the first and the last sections should stand on the corresponding ground levels;  the sections between may be either on the ground level or higher, but not higher than k\xe2\x88\x921k\xe2\x88\x921 from the ground level hihi (the height should be an integer); '
b'  One of possible fences (blue color) for the first test case '
b'Is it possible to build a fence that meets all rules?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; 2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41082\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4108)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of sections in the fence and the height of each section.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hnh1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hn (0\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41080\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4108), where hihi is the ground level beneath the ii-th section.'
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of nn over test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b"For each test case print YES if it's possible to build the fence that meets all rules. Otherwise, print NO."
b'You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).'
