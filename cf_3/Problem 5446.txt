b"Berlanders like to eat cones after a hard day. Misha Square and Sasha Circle are local authorities of Berland. Each of them controls its points of cone trade. Misha has n points, Sasha \xe2\x80\x94 m. Since their subordinates constantly had conflicts with each other, they decided to build a fence in the form of a circle, so that the points of trade of one businessman are strictly inside a circle, and points of the other one are strictly outside. It doesn't matter which of the two gentlemen will have his trade points inside the circle."
b'Determine whether they can build a fence or not.'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains two integers n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910000), numbers of Misha's and Sasha's trade points respectively."
b"The next n lines contains pairs of space-separated integers Mx,\xe2\x80\x89My (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89104\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89Mx,\xe2\x80\x89My\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89104), coordinates of Misha's trade points."
b"The next m lines contains pairs of space-separated integers Sx,\xe2\x80\x89Sy (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89104\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89Sx,\xe2\x80\x89Sy\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89104), coordinates of Sasha's trade points."
b'It is guaranteed that all n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89m points are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'The only output line should contain either word "YES" without quotes in case it is possible to build a such fence or word "NO" in the other case.'
