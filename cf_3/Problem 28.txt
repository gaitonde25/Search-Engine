b'You are given nn words of equal length mm, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters. The ii-th word is denoted sisi.'
b'In one move you can choose any position in any single word and change the letter at that position to the previous or next letter in alphabetical order. For example:'
b"  you can change 'e' to 'd' or to 'f';  'a' can only be changed to 'b';  'z' can only be changed to 'y'. "
b'The difference between two words is the minimum number of moves required to make them equal. For example, the difference between "best" and "cost" is 1+10+0+0=111+10+0+0=11.'
b'Find the minimum difference of sisi and sjsj such that (i<j)(i<j). In other words, find the minimum difference over all possible pairs of the nn words.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains 22 integers nn and mm (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4502\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa481\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa48) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of strings and their length respectively.'
b'Then follows nn lines, the ii-th of which containing a single string sisi of length mm, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum difference over all possible pairs of the given strings.'
