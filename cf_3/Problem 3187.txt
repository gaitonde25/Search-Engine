b'Ivan plays some computer game. There are nn quests in the game. Each quest can be upgraded once, this increases the reward for its completion. Each quest has 33 parameters aiai, bibi, pipi: reward for completing quest before upgrade, reward for completing quest after upgrade (ai<biai<bi) and probability of successful completing the quest.'
b'Each second Ivan can try to complete one quest and he will succeed with probability pipi. In case of success Ivan will get the reward and opportunity to upgrade any one quest (not necessary the one he just completed). In case of failure he gets nothing. Quests do not vanish after completing.'
b'Ivan has tt seconds. He wants to maximize expected value of his total gain after tt seconds. Help him to calculate this value.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains 22 integers nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) and tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410101\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41010)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of quests and total time.'
b'Following nn lines contain description of quests. Each description is 33 numbers aiai bibi pipi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai<bi\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4ai<bi\xe2\x89\xa4108, 0<pi<10<pi<1)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 reward for completing quest before upgrade, reward for completing quest after upgrade and probability of successful completing of quest. aiai and bibi are integers. All probabilities are given with at most 99 decimal places.'
b'Output'
b'Print the expected value.'
b"Your answer will be accepted if absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926. Formally, let your answer be aa, and the jury's answer be bb. Your answer is considered correct if |a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(b,1)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926|a\xe2\x88\x92b|max\xe2\x81\xa1(b,1)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926."
