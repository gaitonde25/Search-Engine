b'R3D3 spent some time on an internship in MDCS. After earning enough money, he decided to go on a holiday somewhere far, far away. He enjoyed suntanning, drinking alcohol-free cocktails and going to concerts of popular local bands. While listening to "The White Buttons" and their hit song "Dacan the Baker", he met another robot for whom he was sure is the love of his life. Well, his summer, at least. Anyway, R3D3 was too shy to approach his potential soulmate, so he decided to write her a love letter. However, he stumbled upon a problem. Due to a terrorist threat, the Intergalactic Space Police was monitoring all letters sent in the area. Thus, R3D3 decided to invent his own alphabet, for which he was sure his love would be able to decipher.'
b"There are n letters in R3D3\xe2\x80\x99s alphabet, and he wants to represent each letter as a sequence of '0' and '1', so that no letter\xe2\x80\x99s sequence is a prefix of another letter's sequence. Since the Intergalactic Space Communications Service has lately introduced a tax for invented alphabets, R3D3 must pay a certain amount of money for each bit in his alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s code (check the sample test for clarifications). He is too lovestruck to think clearly, so he asked you for help."
b"Given the costs c0 and c1 for each '0' and '1' in R3D3\xe2\x80\x99s alphabet, respectively, you should come up with a coding for the alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost."
b'Input'
b"The first line of input contains three integers n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89108), c0 and c1 (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89c0,\xe2\x80\x89c1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89108)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively. "
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet.'
