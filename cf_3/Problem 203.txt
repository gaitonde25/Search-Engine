b"Madoka's father just reached 11 million subscribers on Mathub! So the website decided to send him a personalized award\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 The Mathhub's Bit Button! "
b'The Bit Button is a rectangular table with nn rows and mm columns with 00 or 11 in each cell. After exploring the table Madoka found out that:'
b" A subrectangle AA is contained in a subrectangle BB if there's no cell contained in AA but not contained in BB. Two subrectangles intersect if there is a cell contained in both of them. A subrectangle is called black if there's no cell with value 00 inside it. A subrectangle is called nice if it's black and it's not contained in another black subrectangle. The table is called elegant if there are no two nice intersecting subrectangles."
b"For example, in the first illustration the red subrectangle is nice, but in the second one it's not, because it's contained in the purple subrectangle."
b'  '
b'Help Madoka to determine whether the table is elegant.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4200)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two positive integers n,mn,m (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4100).'
b'The next nn lines contain strings of length mm consisting of zeros and ones\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the description of the table.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of nn and the sum of the values of mm for all test cases do not exceed 777777.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print "YES" if its table is elegant or print "NO" otherwise.'
b'You may print each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs" will all be recognized as positive answer).'
