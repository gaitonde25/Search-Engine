b"You are given a tree consisting of nn nodes. You want to write some labels on the tree's edges such that the following conditions hold:"
b'  Every label is an integer between 00 and n\xe2\x88\x922n\xe2\x88\x922 inclusive.  All the written labels are distinct.  The largest value among MEX(u,v)MEX(u,v) over all pairs of nodes (u,v)(u,v) is as small as possible. '
b"Here, MEX(u,v)MEX(u,v) denotes the smallest non-negative integer that isn't written on any edge on the unique simple path from node uu to node vv."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of nodes in the tree.'
b"Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n) that mean there's an edge between nodes uu and vv. It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree."
b'Output'
b'Output n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 integers. The ithith of them will be the number written on the ithith edge (in the input order).'
