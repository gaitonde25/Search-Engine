b'Karl likes Codeforces and subsequences. He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least kk subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.'
b'Formally, a codeforces subsequence of a string ss is a subset of ten characters of ss that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times: codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome.'
b'Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least kk codeforces subsequences.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains a single integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41016)1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41016).'
b'Output'
b'Print a shortest string of lowercase English letters that contains at least kk codeforces subsequences. If there are several such strings, print any of them.'
