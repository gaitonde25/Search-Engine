b"A star is a figure of the following type: an asterisk character '*' in the center of the figure and four rays (to the left, right, top, bottom) of the same positive length. The size of a star is the length of its rays. The size of a star must be a positive number (i.e. rays of length 00 are not allowed)."
b"Let's consider empty cells are denoted by '.', then the following figures are stars:"
b'  The leftmost figure is a star of size 11, the middle figure is a star of size 22 and the rightmost figure is a star of size 33. '
b"You are given a rectangular grid of size n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m consisting only of asterisks '*' and periods (dots) '.'. Rows are numbered from 11 to nn, columns are numbered from 11 to mm. Your task is to draw this grid using any number of stars or find out that it is impossible. Stars can intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other. The number of stars in the output can't exceed n\xe2\x8b\x85mn\xe2\x8b\x85m. Each star should be completely inside the grid. You can use stars of same and arbitrary sizes."
b'In this problem, you do not need to minimize the number of stars. Just find any way to draw the given grid with at most n\xe2\x8b\x85mn\xe2\x8b\x85m stars.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and mm (3\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa410003\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the sizes of the given grid.'
b"The next nn lines contains mm characters each, the ii-th line describes the ii-th row of the grid. It is guaranteed that grid consists of characters '*' and '.' only."
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to draw the given grid using stars only, print "-1".'
b'Otherwise in the first line print one integer kk (0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x8b\x85m0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x8b\x85m) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of stars needed to draw the given grid. The next kk lines should contain three integers each \xe2\x80\x94 xjxj, yjyj and sjsj, where xjxj is the row index of the central star character, yjyj is the column index of the central star character and sjsj is the size of the star. Each star should be completely inside the grid.'
