b'The Squareland national forest is divided into equal 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 square plots aligned with north-south and east-west directions. Each plot can be uniquely described by integer Cartesian coordinates (x,y)(x,y) of its south-west corner.'
b'Three friends, Alice, Bob, and Charlie are going to buy three distinct plots of land A,B,CA,B,C in the forest. Initially, all plots in the forest (including the plots A,B,CA,B,C) are covered by trees. The friends want to visit each other, so they want to clean some of the plots from trees. After cleaning, one should be able to reach any of the plots A,B,CA,B,C from any other one of those by moving through adjacent cleared plots. Two plots are adjacent if they share a side.'
b'  For example, A=(0,0)A=(0,0), B=(1,1)B=(1,1), C=(2,2)C=(2,2). The minimal number of plots to be cleared is 55. One of the ways to do it is shown with the gray color. '
b"Of course, the friends don't want to strain too much. Help them find out the smallest number of plots they need to clean from trees."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers xAxA and yAyA\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of the plot AA (0\xe2\x89\xa4xA,yA\xe2\x89\xa410000\xe2\x89\xa4xA,yA\xe2\x89\xa41000). The following two lines describe coordinates (xB,yB)(xB,yB) and (xC,yC)(xC,yC) of plots BB and CC respectively in the same format (0\xe2\x89\xa4xB,yB,xC,yC\xe2\x89\xa410000\xe2\x89\xa4xB,yB,xC,yC\xe2\x89\xa41000). It is guaranteed that all three plots are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'On the first line print a single integer kk\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the smallest number of plots needed to be cleaned from trees. The following kk lines should contain coordinates of all plots needed to be cleaned. All kk plots should be distinct. You can output the plots in any order.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.'
