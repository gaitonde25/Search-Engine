b"The programming competition season has already started and it's time to train for ICPC. Sereja coaches his teams for a number of year and he knows that to get ready for the training session it's not enough to prepare only problems and editorial. As the training sessions lasts for several hours, teams become hungry. Thus, Sereja orders a number of pizzas so they can eat right after the end of the competition."
b'Teams plan to train for n times during n consecutive days. During the training session Sereja orders exactly one pizza for each team that is present this day. He already knows that there will be ai teams on the i-th day.'
b"There are two types of discounts in Sereja's favourite pizzeria. The first discount works if one buys two pizzas at one day, while the second is a coupon that allows to buy one pizza during two consecutive days (two pizzas in total)."
b'As Sereja orders really a lot of pizza at this place, he is the golden client and can use the unlimited number of discounts and coupons of any type at any days.'
b"Sereja wants to order exactly ai pizzas on the i-th day while using only discounts and coupons. Note, that he will never buy more pizzas than he need for this particular day. Help him determine, whether he can buy the proper amount of pizzas each day if he is allowed to use only coupons and discounts. Note, that it's also prohibited to have any active coupons after the end of the day n."
