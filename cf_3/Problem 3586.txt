b'Petr likes to come up with problems about randomly generated data. This time problem is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random permutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from 11 to nn and then 3n3n times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation just like Petr but swaps elements 7n+17n+1 times instead of 3n3n times. Because it is more random, OK?!'
b'You somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from which one.'
b'Input'
b'In the first line of input there is one integer nn (103\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106103\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106).'
b'In the second line there are nn distinct integers between 11 and nn\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the permutation of size nn from the test.'
b'It is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we choose nn\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method to generate a permutation\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate a permutation using chosen method.'
b'Output'
b'If the test is generated via Petr\'s method print "Petr" (without quotes). If the test is generated via Alex\'s method print "Um_nik" (without quotes).'
