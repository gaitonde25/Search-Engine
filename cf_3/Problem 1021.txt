b"You are given a string ss consisting of lowercase English letters and a number kk. Let's call a string consisting of lowercase English letters beautiful if the number of occurrences of each letter in that string is divisible by kk. You are asked to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length nn, which is lexicographically greater or equal to string ss. If such a string does not exist, output \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921."
b'A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds: '
b'  aa is a prefix of bb, but a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The next 2\xe2\x8b\x85T2\xe2\x8b\x85T lines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.'
b'The first line of the description contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of string ss and number kk respectively.'
b'The second line contains string ss consisting of lowercase English letters.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output in a separate line lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length nn, which is greater or equal to string ss, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if such a string does not exist.'
