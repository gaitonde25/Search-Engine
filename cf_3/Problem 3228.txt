Note that when a guest is the only one in his circle, the lili chairs to his left and riri chairs to his right may overlap.'

b'First line contains one integer nn \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of guests, (1\xe2\xa9\xbdn\xe2\xa9\xbd1051\xe2\xa9\xbdn\xe2\xa9\xbd105). '
b'Next nn lines contain nn pairs of space-separated integers lili and riri (0\xe2\xa9\xbdli,ri\xe2\xa9\xbd1090\xe2\xa9\xbdli,ri\xe2\xa9\xbd109).'
