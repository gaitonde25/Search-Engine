b'You are given an integer nn. Check if nn has an odd divisor, greater than one (does there exist such a number xx (x>1x>1) that nn is divisible by xx and xx is odd).'
b'For example, if n=6n=6, then there is x=3x=3. If n=4n=4, then such a number does not exist.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410142\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41014).'
b"Please note, that the input for some test cases won't fit into 3232-bit integer type, so you should use at least 6464-bit integer type in your programming language."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output on a separate line: '
b'  "YES" if nn has an odd divisor, greater than one;  "NO" otherwise. '
b'You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).'
