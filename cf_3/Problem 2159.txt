b'Two players decided to play one interesting card game.'
b'There is a deck of nn cards, with values from 11 to nn. The values of cards are pairwise different (this means that no two different cards have equal values). At the beginning of the game, the deck is completely distributed between players such that each player has at least one card. '
b"The game goes as follows: on each turn, each player chooses one of their cards (whichever they want) and puts on the table, so that the other player doesn't see which card they chose. After that, both cards are revealed, and the player, value of whose card was larger, takes both cards in his hand. Note that as all cards have different values, one of the cards will be strictly larger than the other one. Every card may be played any amount of times. The player loses if he doesn't have any cards."
b'For example, suppose that n=5n=5, the first player has cards with values 22 and 33, and the second player has cards with values 11, 44, 55. Then one possible flow of the game is:'
b'The first player chooses the card 33. The second player chooses the card 11. As 3>13>1, the first player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards 11, 22, 33, the second player has cards 44, 55.The first player chooses the card 33. The second player chooses the card 44. As 3<43<4, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has cards 11, 22. The second player has cards 33, 44, 55.The first player chooses the card 11. The second player chooses the card 33. As 1<31<3, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player has only the card 22. The second player has cards 11, 33, 44, 55.The first player chooses the card 22. The second player chooses the card 44. As 2<42<4, the second player gets both cards. Now the first player is out of cards and loses. Therefore, the second player wins.'
b'Who will win if both players are playing optimally? It can be shown that one of the players has a winning strategy.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100). The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains three integers nn, k1k1, k2k2 (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921,1\xe2\x89\xa4k2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921,k1+k2=n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921,1\xe2\x89\xa4k2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921,k1+k2=n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cards, number of cards owned by the first player and second player correspondingly.'
b'The second line of each test case contains k1k1 integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ak1a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ak1 (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the values of cards of the first player.'
b'The third line of each test case contains k2k2 integers b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bk2b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bk2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the values of cards of the second player.'
b'It is guaranteed that the values of all cards are different.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line, if the first player wins. Otherwise, output "NO" in a separate line. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
