b'There are nn positive integers written on the blackboard. Also, a positive number k\xe2\x89\xa52k\xe2\x89\xa52 is chosen, and none of the numbers on the blackboard are divisible by kk. In one operation, you can choose any two integers xx and yy, erase them and write one extra number f(x+y)f(x+y), where f(x)f(x) is equal to xx if xx is not divisible by kk, otherwise f(x)=f(x/k)f(x)=f(x/k).'
b'In the end, there will be a single number of the blackboard. Is it possible to make the final number equal to 11? If so, restore any sequence of operations to do so.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial number of integers on the blackboard, and the chosen number (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4162\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa416, 2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa420002\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42000).'
b'The second line contains nn positive integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an initially written on the blackboard. It is guaranteed that none of the numbers aiai is divisible by kk, and the sum of all aiai does not exceed 20002000.'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to obtain 11 as the final number, print "NO" in the only line.'
b'Otherwise, print "YES" on the first line, followed by n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describing operations. The ii-th of these lines has to contain two integers xixi and yiyi to be erased and replaced with f(xi+yi)f(xi+yi) on the ii-th operation. If there are several suitable ways, output any of them.'
