b'Recently Petya walked in the forest and found a magic stick.'
b'Since Petya really likes numbers, the first thing he learned was spells for changing numbers. So far, he knows only two spells that can be applied to a positive integer: '
b'  If the chosen number aa is even, then the spell will turn it into 3a23a2;  If the chosen number aa is greater than one, then the spell will turn it into a\xe2\x88\x921a\xe2\x88\x921. '
b'Note that if the number is even and greater than one, then Petya can choose which spell to apply.'
b'Petya now has only one number xx. He wants to know if his favorite number yy can be obtained from xx using the spells he knows. The spells can be used any number of times in any order. It is not required to use spells, Petya can leave xx as it is.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains single integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers xx and yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the current number and the number that Petya wants to get.'
b'Output'
b'For the ii-th test case print the answer on it \xe2\x80\x94 YES if Petya can get the number yy from the number xx using known spells, and NO otherwise.'
b'You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).'
