b"Bakry faced a problem, but since he's lazy to solve it, he asks for your help."
b'You are given a tree of nn nodes, the ii-th node has value aiai assigned to it for each ii from 11 to nn. As a reminder, a tree on nn nodes is a connected graph with n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 edges.'
b'You want to delete at least 11, but at most k\xe2\x88\x921k\xe2\x88\x921 edges from the tree, so that the following condition would hold:'
b'For every connected component calculate the bitwise XOR of the values of the nodes in it. Then, these values have to be the same for all connected components.'
b'Is it possible to achieve this condition?'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)(2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,...,ana1,a2,...,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b"The ii-th of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers uiui and vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi), which means that there's an edge between nodes uiui and vivi."
b'It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, you should output a single string. If you can delete the edges according to the conditions written above, output "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, output "NO" (without quotes).'
b'You can print each letter of "YES" and "NO" in any case (upper or lower).'
