b"ZS the Coder is playing a game. There is a number displayed on the screen and there are two buttons, '\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89' (plus) and '' (square root). Initially, the number 2 is displayed on the screen. There are n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891 levels in the game and ZS the Coder start at the level 1."
b'When ZS the Coder is at level k, he can :'
b"  Press the '\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89' button. This increases the number on the screen by exactly k. So, if the number on the screen was x, it becomes x\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89k. Press the '' button. Let the number on the screen be x. After pressing this button, the number becomes . After that, ZS the Coder levels up, so his current level becomes k\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891. This button can only be pressed when x is a perfect square, i.e. x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89m2 for some positive integer m. "
b"Additionally, after each move, if ZS the Coder is at level k, and the number on the screen is m, then m must be a multiple of k. Note that this condition is only checked after performing the press. For example, if ZS the Coder is at level 4 and current number is 100, he presses the '' button and the number turns into 10. Note that at this moment, 10 is not divisible by 4, but this press is still valid, because after it, ZS the Coder is at level 5, and 10 is divisible by 5."
b"ZS the Coder needs your help in beating the game\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he wants to reach level n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891. In other words, he needs to press the '' button n times. Help him determine the number of times he should press the '\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89' button before pressing the '' button at each level. "
b'Please note that ZS the Coder wants to find just any sequence of presses allowing him to reach level n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891, but not necessarily a sequence minimizing the number of presses.'
b'Input'
b'The first and only line of the input contains a single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000), denoting that ZS the Coder wants to reach level n\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891.'
b'Output'
b"Print n non-negative integers, one per line. i-th of them should be equal to the number of times that ZS the Coder needs to press the '\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89' button before pressing the '' button at level i. "
b'Each number in the output should not exceed 1018. However, the number on the screen can be greater than 1018.'
b'It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.'
