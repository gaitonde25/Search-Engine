b'There are n frogs sitting on the coordinate axis Ox. For each frog two values xi,\xe2\x80\x89ti are known \xe2\x80\x94 the position and the initial length of the tongue of the i-th frog (it is guaranteed that all positions xi are different). m mosquitoes one by one are landing to the coordinate axis. For each mosquito two values are known pj \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinate of the position where the j-th mosquito lands and bj \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the j-th mosquito. Frogs and mosquitoes are represented as points on the coordinate axis.'
b'The frog can eat mosquito if mosquito is in the same position with the frog or to the right, and the distance between them is not greater than the length of the tongue of the frog.'
b"If at some moment several frogs can eat a mosquito the leftmost frog will eat it (with minimal xi). After eating a mosquito the length of the tongue of a frog increases with the value of the size of eaten mosquito. It's possible that after it the frog will be able to eat some other mosquitoes (the frog should eat them in this case)."
b'For each frog print two values \xe2\x80\x94 the number of eaten mosquitoes and the length of the tongue after landing all mosquitoes and after eating all possible mosquitoes by frogs.'
b'Each mosquito is landing to the coordinate axis only after frogs eat all possible mosquitoes landed before. Mosquitoes are given in order of their landing to the coordinate axis.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains two integers n,\xe2\x80\x89m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of frogs and mosquitoes.'
b'Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi,\xe2\x80\x89ti (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89xi,\xe2\x80\x89ti\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109) \xe2\x80\x94 the position and the initial length of the tongue of the i-th frog. It is guaranteed that all xi are different.'
b'Next m lines contain two integers each pj,\xe2\x80\x89bj (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pj,\xe2\x80\x89bj\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109) \xe2\x80\x94 the position and the size of the j-th mosquito.'
b'Output'
b'Print n lines. The i-th line should contain two integer values ci,\xe2\x80\x89li \xe2\x80\x94 the number of mosquitoes eaten by the i-th frog and the length of the tongue of the i-th frog.'
