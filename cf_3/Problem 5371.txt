b'You are given three sticks with positive integer lengths of a,\xe2\x80\x89b, and c centimeters. You can increase length of some of them by some positive integer number of centimeters (different sticks can be increased by a different length), but in total by at most l centimeters. In particular, it is allowed not to increase the length of any stick.'
b'Determine the number of ways to increase the lengths of some sticks so that you can form from them a non-degenerate (that is, having a positive area) triangle. Two ways are considered different, if the length of some stick is increased by different number of centimeters in them.'
b'Input'
b'The single line contains 4 integers a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c,\xe2\x80\x89l (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893\xc2\xb7105, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893\xc2\xb7105).'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to increase the sizes of the sticks by the total of at most l centimeters, so that you can make a non-degenerate triangle from it.'
