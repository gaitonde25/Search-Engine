b'There are n cities in Berland, each of them has a unique id\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 an integer from 1 to n, the capital is the one with id 1. Now there is a serious problem in Berland with roads\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 there are no roads.'
b'That is why there was a decision to build n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 roads so that there will be exactly one simple path between each pair of cities.'
b'In the construction plan t integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89at were stated, where t equals to the distance from the capital to the most distant city, concerning new roads. ai equals the number of cities which should be at the distance i from the capital. The distance between two cities is the number of roads one has to pass on the way from one city to another. '
b"Also, it was decided that among all the cities except the capital there should be exactly k cities with exactly one road going from each of them. Such cities are dead-ends and can't be economically attractive. In calculation of these cities the capital is not taken into consideration regardless of the number of roads from it. "
b"Your task is to offer a plan of road's construction which satisfies all the described conditions or to inform that it is impossible."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three positive numbers n, t and k (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89t,\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the distance to the most distant city from the capital and the number of cities which should be dead-ends (the capital in this number is not taken into consideration). '
b'The second line contains a sequence of t integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89at (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89n), the i-th number is the number of cities which should be at the distance i from the capital. It is guaranteed that the sum of all the values ai equals n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891.'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to built roads which satisfy all conditions, print -1.'
b'Otherwise, in the first line print one integer n\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities in Berland. In the each of the next n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 line print two integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the ids of cities that are connected by a road. Each road should be printed exactly once. You can print the roads and the cities connected by a road in any order.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Remember that the capital has id 1.'
