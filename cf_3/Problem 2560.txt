b'Tokitsukaze is playing a room escape game designed by SkywalkerT. In this game, she needs to find out hidden clues in the room to reveal a way to escape.'
b'After a while, she realizes that the only way to run away is to open the digital door lock since she accidentally went into a secret compartment and found some clues, which can be interpreted as:'
b"  Only when you enter nn possible different passwords can you open the door;  Passwords must be integers ranged from 00 to (m\xe2\x88\x921)(m\xe2\x88\x921);  A password cannot be xx (0\xe2\x89\xa4x<m0\xe2\x89\xa4x<m) if xx and mm are not coprime (i.e. xx and mm have some common divisor greater than 11);  A password cannot be xx (0\xe2\x89\xa4x<m0\xe2\x89\xa4x<m) if there exist non-negative integers ee and kk such that pe=km+xpe=km+x, where pp is a secret integer;  Any integer that doesn't break the above rules can be a password;  Several integers are hidden in the room, but only one of them can be pp. "
b"Fortunately, she finds that nn and mm are recorded in the lock. However, what makes Tokitsukaze frustrated is that she doesn't do well in math. Now that she has found an integer that is suspected to be pp, she wants you to help her find out nn possible passwords, or determine the integer cannot be pp."
b'Input'
b'The only line contains three integers nn, mm and pp (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xc3\x971051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xc3\x97105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4p<m\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4p<m\xe2\x89\xa41018).'
b'It is guaranteed that mm is a positive integer power of a single prime number.'
b'Output'
b'If the number of possible different passwords is less than nn, print a single integer \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Otherwise, print nn distinct integers ranged from 00 to (m\xe2\x88\x921)(m\xe2\x88\x921) as passwords. You can print these integers in any order. Besides, if there are multiple solutions, print any.'
