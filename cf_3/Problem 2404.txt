b'You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich \xe2\x80\x94 a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads! '
b'  '
b"Initially Zmei Gorynich has xx heads. You can deal nn types of blows. If you deal a blow of the ii-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by min(di,curX)min(di,curX), there curXcurX is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows hihi new heads. If curX=0curX=0 then Gorynich is defeated. "
b'You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.'
b'For example, if curX=10curX=10, d=7d=7, h=10h=10 then the number of heads changes to 1313 (you cut 77 heads off, but then Zmei grows 1010 new ones), but if curX=10curX=10, d=11d=11, h=100h=100 then number of heads changes to 00 and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.'
b'Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!'
b'You have to answer tt independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x93 the number of queries.'
b'The first line of each query contains two integers nn and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of possible types of blows and the number of heads Zmei initially has, respectively.'
b'The following nn lines of each query contain the descriptions of types of blows you can deal. The ii-th line contains two integers didi and hihi (1\xe2\x89\xa4di,hi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4di,hi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the description of the ii-th blow.'
b'Output'
b'For each query print the minimum number of blows you have to deal to defeat Zmei Gorynich. '
b'If Zmei Gorynuch cannot be defeated print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
