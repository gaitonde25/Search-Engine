b'As Famil Door\xe2\x80\x99s birthday is coming, some of his friends (like Gabi) decided to buy a present for him. His friends are going to buy a string consisted of round brackets since Famil Door loves string of brackets of length n more than any other strings!'
b'The sequence of round brackets is called valid if and only if: '
b'  the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets;  for any prefix of the sequence, the number of opening brackets is greater or equal than the number of closing brackets. '
b'Gabi bought a string s of length m (m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) and want to complete it to obtain a valid sequence of brackets of length n. He is going to pick some strings p and q consisting of round brackets and merge them in a string p\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89s\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89q, that is add the string p at the beginning of the string s and string q at the end of the string s.'
b'Now he wonders, how many pairs of strings p and q exists, such that the string p\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89s\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89q is a valid sequence of round brackets. As this number may be pretty large, he wants to calculate it modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000,\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the desired length of the string and the length of the string bought by Gabi, respectively.'
b"The second line contains string s of length m consisting of characters '(' and ')' only."
b'Output'
b'Print the number of pairs of string p and q such that p\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89s\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89q is a valid sequence of round brackets modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.'
