b'Every superhero has been given a power value by the Felicity Committee. The avengers crew wants to maximize the average power of the superheroes in their team by performing certain operations.'
b'Initially, there are nn superheroes in avengers team having powers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an, respectively. In one operation, they can remove one superhero from their team (if there are at least two) or they can increase the power of a superhero by 11. They can do at most mm operations. Also, on a particular superhero at most kk operations can be done.'
b'Can you help the avengers team to maximize the average power of their crew?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, kk and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41071\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4107)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of superheroes, the maximum number of times you can increase power of a particular superhero, and the total maximum number of operations.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial powers of the superheroes in the cast of avengers.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum final average power.'
