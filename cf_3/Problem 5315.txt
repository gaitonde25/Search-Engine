b'Olesya loves numbers consisting of n digits, and Rodion only likes numbers that are divisible by t. Find some number that satisfies both of them.'
b"Your task is: given the n and t print an integer strictly larger than zero consisting of n digits that is divisible by t. If such number doesn't exist, print \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891."
b'Input'
b'The single line contains two numbers, n and t (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100, 2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89t\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the number and the number it should be divisible by.'
b'Output'
b"Print one such positive number without leading zeroes, \xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the problem, or \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891, if such number doesn't exist. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them."
