b"Ashish has a string ss of length nn containing only characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'."
b'He wants to find the length of the smallest substring, which satisfies the following conditions: '
b"  Length of the substring is at least 22  'a' occurs strictly more times in this substring than 'b'  'a' occurs strictly more times in this substring than 'c' "
b' '
b'Ashish is busy planning his next Codeforces round. Help him solve the problem.'
b'A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106)(2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string ss.'
b"The second line of each test case contains a string ss consisting only of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 106106.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output the length of the smallest substring which satisfies the given conditions or print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if there is no such substring.'
