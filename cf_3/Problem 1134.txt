b"Every year Santa Claus gives gifts to all children. However, each country has its own traditions, and this process takes place in different ways. For example, in Berland you need to solve the New Year's puzzle."
b'Polycarp got the following problem: given a grid strip of size 2\xc3\x97n2\xc3\x97n, some cells of it are blocked. You need to check if it is possible to tile all free cells using the 2\xc3\x9712\xc3\x971 and 1\xc3\x9721\xc3\x972 tiles (dominoes).'
b'For example, if n=5n=5 and the strip looks like this (black cells are blocked):'
b'  '
b'Then it can be tiled, for example, using two vertical and two horizontal tiles, as in the picture below (different tiles are marked by different colors).'
b'  '
b'And if n=3n=3 and the strip looks like this:'
b'  '
b'It is impossible to tile free cells.'
b"Polycarp easily solved this task and received his New Year's gift. Can you solve it?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case is preceded by an empty line.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the strip and the number of blocked cells on it.'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two integers ri,ciri,ci (1\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa42,1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa42,1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 numbers of rows and columns of blocked cells. It is guaranteed that all blocked cells are different, i.e. (ri,ci)\xe2\x89\xa0(rj,cj),i\xe2\x89\xa0j(ri,ci)\xe2\x89\xa0(rj,cj),i\xe2\x89\xa0j.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of mm over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print on a separate line: '
b'  "YES", if it is possible to tile all unblocked squares with the 2\xc3\x9712\xc3\x971 and 1\xc3\x9721\xc3\x972 tiles;  "NO" otherwise. '
b'You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).'
