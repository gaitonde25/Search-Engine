b'Several days ago you bought a new house and now you are planning to start a renovation. Since winters in your region can be very cold you need to decide how to heat rooms in your house.'
b'Your house has nn rooms. In the ii-th room you can install at most cici heating radiators. Each radiator can have several sections, but the cost of the radiator with kk sections is equal to k2k2 burles.'
b'Since rooms can have different sizes, you calculated that you need at least sumisumi sections in total in the ii-th room. '
b'For each room calculate the minimum cost to install at most cici radiators with total number of sections not less than sumisumi.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rooms.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains the description of some room. The ii-th line contains two integers cici and sumisumi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci,sumi\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4ci,sumi\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of radiators and the minimum total number of sections in the ii-th room, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'For each room print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible cost to install at most cici radiators with total number of sections not less than sumisumi.'
