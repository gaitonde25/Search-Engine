b'This problem is actually a subproblem of problem G from the same contest.'
b'There are nn candies in a candy box. The type of the ii-th candy is aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'You have to prepare a gift using some of these candies with the following restriction: the numbers of candies of each type presented in a gift should be all distinct (i.\xe2\x80\x89e. for example, a gift having two candies of type 11 and two candies of type 22 is bad). '
b'It is possible that multiple types of candies are completely absent from the gift. It is also possible that not all candies of some types will be taken to a gift.'
b'Your task is to find out the maximum possible size of the single gift you can prepare using the candies you have.'
b'You have to answer qq independent queries.'
b'If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries. Each query is represented by two lines.'
b'The first line of each query contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies.'
b'The second line of each query contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n), where aiai is the type of the ii-th candy in the box.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all queries does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each query print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible size of the single gift you can compose using candies you got in this query with the restriction described in the problem statement.'
