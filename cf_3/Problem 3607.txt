b'You\'re given a row with nn chairs. We call a seating of people "maximal" if the two following conditions hold:'
b"  There are no neighbors adjacent to anyone seated.  It's impossible to seat one more person without violating the first rule. "
b'The seating is given as a string consisting of zeros and ones (00 means that the corresponding seat is empty, 11 \xe2\x80\x94 occupied). The goal is to determine whether this seating is "maximal".'
b'Note that the first and last seats are not adjacent (if n\xe2\x89\xa02n\xe2\x89\xa02).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of chairs.'
b'The next line contains a string of nn characters, each of them is either zero or one, describing the seating.'
b'Output'
b'Output "Yes" (without quotation marks) if the seating is "maximal". Otherwise print "No".'
b"You are allowed to print letters in whatever case you'd like (uppercase or lowercase)."
