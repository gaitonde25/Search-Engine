b'Eleven wants to choose a new name for herself. As a bunch of geeks, her friends suggested an algorithm to choose a name for her. Eleven wants her name to have exactly n characters. '
b'  '
b"Her friend suggested that her name should only consist of uppercase and lowercase letters 'O'. More precisely, they suggested that the i-th letter of her name should be 'O' (uppercase) if i is a member of Fibonacci sequence, and 'o' (lowercase) otherwise. The letters in the name are numbered from 1 to n. Fibonacci sequence is the sequence f where"

b'As her friends are too young to know what Fibonacci sequence is, they asked you to help Eleven determine her new name.'
