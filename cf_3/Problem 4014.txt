b"There are two main kinds of events in the life of top-model: fashion shows and photo shoots. Participating in any of these events affects the rating of appropriate top-model. After each photo shoot model's rating increases by a and after each fashion show decreases by b (designers do too many experiments nowadays). Moreover, sometimes top-models participates in talk shows. After participating in talk show model becomes more popular and increasing of her rating after photo shoots become c and decreasing of her rating after fashion show becomes d."
b'Izabella wants to participate in a talk show, but she wants to do it in such a way that her rating will never become negative. Help her to find a suitable moment for participating in the talk show. '
b"Let's assume that model's career begins in moment 0. At that moment Izabella's rating was equal to start. If talk show happens in moment t if will affect all events in model's life in interval of time [t..t\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89len) (including t and not including t\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89len), where len is duration of influence."
b'Izabella wants to participate in a talk show, but she wants to do it in such a way that her rating will not become become negative before talk show or during period of influence of talk show. Help her to find a suitable moment for participating in the talk show. '
b'Input'
b'In first line there are 7 positive integers n, a, b, c, d, start, len (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893\xc2\xb7105, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89start\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c,\xe2\x80\x89d,\xe2\x80\x89len\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109), where n is a number of fashion shows and photo shoots, a, b, c and d are rating changes described above, start is an initial rating of model and len is a duration of influence of talk show.'
b'In next n lines descriptions of events are given. Each of those lines contains two integers ti and qi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ti\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89q\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 moment, in which event happens and type of this event. Type 0 corresponds to the fashion show and type 1\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 to photo shoot. '
b'Events are given in order of increasing ti, all ti are different.'
b'Output'
b"Print one non-negative integer t\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the moment of time in which talk show should happen to make Izabella's rating non-negative before talk show and during period of influence of talk show. If there are multiple answers print smallest of them. If there are no such moments, print \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891."
