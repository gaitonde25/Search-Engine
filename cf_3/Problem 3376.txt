b'You are given a string tt consisting of nn lowercase Latin letters and an integer number kk.'
b"Let's define a substring of some string ss with indices from ll to rr as s[l\xe2\x80\xa6r]s[l\xe2\x80\xa6r]."
b'Your task is to construct such string ss of minimum possible length that there are exactly kk positions ii such that s[i\xe2\x80\xa6i+n\xe2\x88\x921]=ts[i\xe2\x80\xa6i+n\xe2\x88\x921]=t. In other words, your task is to construct such string ss of minimum possible length that there are exactly kk substrings of ss equal to tt.'
b'It is guaranteed that the answer is always unique.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa450) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string tt and the number of substrings.'
b'The second line of the input contains the string tt consisting of exactly nn lowercase Latin letters.'
b'Output'
b'Print such string ss of minimum possible length that there are exactly kk substrings of ss equal to tt.'
b'It is guaranteed that the answer is always unique.'
