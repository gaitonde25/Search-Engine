b"Suppose you have two strings s and t, and their length is equal. You may perform the following operation any number of times: choose two different characters c1 and c2, and replace every occurence of c1 in both strings with c2. Let's denote the distance between strings s and t as the minimum number of operations required to make these strings equal. For example, if s is abcd and t is ddcb, the distance between them is 2 \xe2\x80\x94 we may replace every occurence of a with b, so s becomes bbcd, and then we may replace every occurence of b with d, so both strings become ddcd."
b'You are given two strings S and T. For every substring of S consisting of |T| characters you have to determine the distance between this substring and T.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the string S, and the second \xe2\x80\x94 the string T (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|T|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|S|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89125000). Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters from a to f.'
b'Output'
b'Print |S|\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89|T|\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891 integers. The i-th of these integers must be equal to the distance between the substring of S beginning at i-th index with length |T| and the string T.'
