b'Santa has to send presents to the kids. He has a large stack of nn presents, numbered from 11 to nn; the topmost present has number a1a1, the next present is a2a2, and so on; the bottom present has number anan. All numbers are distinct.'
b'Santa has a list of mm distinct presents he has to send: b1b1, b2b2, ..., bmbm. He will send them in the order they appear in the list.'
b'To send a present, Santa has to find it in the stack by removing all presents above it, taking this present and returning all removed presents on top of the stack. So, if there are kk presents above the present Santa wants to send, it takes him 2k+12k+1 seconds to do it. Fortunately, Santa can speed the whole process up \xe2\x80\x94 when he returns the presents to the stack, he may reorder them as he wishes (only those which were above the present he wanted to take; the presents below cannot be affected in any way).'
b'What is the minimum time required to send all of the presents, provided that Santa knows the whole list of presents he has to send and reorders the presents optimally? Santa cannot change the order of presents or interact with the stack of presents in any other way.'
b'Your program has to answer tt different test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Then the test cases follow, each represented by three lines.'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of presents in the stack and the number of presents Santa wants to send, respectively.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n, all aiai are unique) \xe2\x80\x94 the order of presents in the stack.'
b'The third line contains mm integers b1b1, b2b2, ..., bmbm (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n, all bibi are unique) \xe2\x80\x94 the ordered list of presents Santa has to send.'
b'The sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of seconds which Santa has to spend sending presents, if he reorders the presents optimally each time he returns them into the stack.'
