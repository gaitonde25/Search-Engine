b'Salem gave you nn sticks with integer positive lengths a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an.'
b"For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from aa to bb is |a\xe2\x88\x92b||a\xe2\x88\x92b|, where |x||x| means the absolute value of xx."
b'A stick length aiai is called almost good for some integer tt if |ai\xe2\x88\x92t|\xe2\x89\xa41|ai\xe2\x88\x92t|\xe2\x89\xa41.'
b"Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer tt and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of tt is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. "
b'As an answer, print the value of tt and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for tt, print any of them.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of sticks.'
b'The second line contains nn integers aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the lengths of the sticks.'
b'Output'
b'Print the value of tt and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for tt, print any of them.'
