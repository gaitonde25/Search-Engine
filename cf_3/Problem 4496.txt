b'Pupils decided to go to amusement park. Some of them were with parents. In total, n people came to the park and they all want to get to the most extreme attraction and roll on it exactly once.'
b'Tickets for group of x people are sold on the attraction, there should be at least one adult in each group (it is possible that the group consists of one adult). The ticket price for such group is c1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89c2\xc2\xb7(x\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891)2 (in particular, if the group consists of one person, then the price is c1). '
b'All pupils who came to the park and their parents decided to split into groups in such a way that each visitor join exactly one group, and the total price of visiting the most extreme attraction is as low as possible. You are to determine this minimum possible total price. There should be at least one adult in each group. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers n, c1 and c2 (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89200\xe2\x80\x89000, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89c1,\xe2\x80\x89c2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89107)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of visitors and parameters for determining the ticket prices for a group.'
b'The second line contains the string of length n, which consists of zeros and ones. If the i-th symbol of the string is zero, then the i-th visitor is a pupil, otherwise the i-th person is an adult. It is guaranteed that there is at least one adult. It is possible that there are no pupils.'
b'Output'
b'Print the minimum price of visiting the most extreme attraction for all pupils and their parents. Each of them should roll on the attraction exactly once.'
