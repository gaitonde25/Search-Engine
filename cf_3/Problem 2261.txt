b'The Berland Army is preparing for a large military parade. It is already decided that the soldiers participating in it will be divided into kk rows, and all rows will contain the same number of soldiers.'
b'Of course, not every arrangement of soldiers into kk rows is suitable. Heights of all soldiers in the same row should not differ by more than 11. The height of each soldier is an integer between 11 and nn.'
b'For each possible height, you know the number of soldiers having this height. To conduct a parade, you have to choose the soldiers participating in it, and then arrange all of the chosen soldiers into kk rows so that both of the following conditions are met:'
b'  each row has the same number of soldiers,  no row contains a pair of soldiers such that their heights differ by 22 or more. '
b'Calculate the maximum number of soldiers who can participate in the parade.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. '
b'Each test case begins with a line containing two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4300001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa430000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410121\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41012) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of different heights of soldiers and the number of rows of soldiers in the parade, respectively.'
b'The second (and final) line of each test case contains nn integers c1c1, c2c2, ..., cncn (0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa410120\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41012), where cici is the number of soldiers having height ii in the Berland Army.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 3000030000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of soldiers that can participate in the parade.'
