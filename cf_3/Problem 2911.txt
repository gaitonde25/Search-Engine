b'You are given an undirected tree of nn vertices. '
b'Some vertices are colored blue, some are colored red and some are uncolored. It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.'
b"You choose an edge and remove it from the tree. Tree falls apart into two connected components. Let's call an edge nice if neither of the resulting components contain vertices of both red and blue colors."
b'How many nice edges are there in the given tree?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa420\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42) \xe2\x80\x94 the colors of the vertices. ai=1ai=1 means that vertex ii is colored red, ai=2ai=2 means that vertex ii is colored blue and ai=0ai=0 means that vertex ii is uncolored.'

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the tree contains at least one red vertex and at least one blue vertex.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of nice edges in the given tree.'
