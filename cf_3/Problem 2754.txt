b'There are nn students standing in a row. Two coaches are forming two teams \xe2\x80\x94 the first coach chooses the first team and the second coach chooses the second team.'
b'The ii-th student has integer programming skill aiai. All programming skills are distinct and between 11 and nn, inclusive.'
b'Firstly, the first coach will choose the student with maximum programming skill among all students not taken into any team, and kk closest students to the left of him and kk closest students to the right of him (if there are less than kk students to the left or to the right, all of them will be chosen). All students that are chosen leave the row and join the first team. Secondly, the second coach will make the same move (but all students chosen by him join the second team). Then again the first coach will make such move, and so on. This repeats until the row becomes empty (i.\xe2\x80\x89e. the process ends when each student becomes to some team).'
b'Your problem is to determine which students will be taken into the first team and which students will be taken into the second team.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of students and the value determining the range of chosen students during each move, respectively.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n), where aiai is the programming skill of the ii-th student. It is guaranteed that all programming skills are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'Print a string of nn characters; ii-th character should be 1 if ii-th student joins the first team, or 2 otherwise.'
