b'Tanya likes cartoons. She knows that nn new cartoons will be released in his favorite cinema: the ii-th of them will be airing from the day aiai to the day bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The cinema has a special offer: there is a huge discount every day when only one cartoon is airing.'
b"Tanya doesn't care which cartoon she will watch but she'd like to save some money. That's why she asks you to find any day xx when only one cartoon will be airing. Formally: find xx such that there is exactly one ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) with ai\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4biai\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4bi. If there are several possible answers, print any of them. If there is no such day, print -1."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The following are descriptions of the tt test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cartoons.'
b'In the next nn lines, the cartoons themselves are described, one per line, by a pair of integers aiai, bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the first and last airing days for the ii-th cartoon.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of the values nn for all test cases in the input does not exceed 20002000.'
