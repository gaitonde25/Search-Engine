b'There are nn slimes in a row. Each slime has an integer value (possibly negative or zero) associated with it.'
b'Any slime can eat its adjacent slime (the closest slime to its left or to its right, assuming that this slime exists). '
b'When a slime with a value xx eats a slime with a value yy, the eaten slime disappears, and the value of the remaining slime changes to x\xe2\x88\x92yx\xe2\x88\x92y.'
b'The slimes will eat each other until there is only one slime left. '
b'Find the maximum possible value of the last slime.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500000) denoting the number of slimes.'
b'The next line contains nn integers aiai (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109), where aiai is the value of ii-th slime.'
b'Output'
b'Print an only integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible value of the last slime.'
