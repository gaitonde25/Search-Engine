b"In Homer's country, there are nn cities numbered 11 to nn and they form a tree. That is, there are (n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x921) undirected roads between these nn cities and every two cities can reach each other through these roads. "
b"Homer's country is an industrial country, and each of the nn cities in it contains some mineral resource. The mineral resource of city ii is labeled aiai. "
b'Homer is given the plans of the country in the following qq years. The plan of the ii-th year is described by four parameters ui,vi,liui,vi,li and riri, and he is asked to find any mineral resource cici such that the following two conditions hold: '
b'  mineral resource cici appears an odd number of times between city uiui and city vivi; and  li\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4rili\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4ri. '
b"As the best friend of Homer, he asks you for help. For every plan, find any such mineral resource cici, or tell him that there doesn't exist one."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) and qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105), indicating the number of cities and the number of plans.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'Then the ii-th line of the following (n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x921) lines contains two integers xixi and yiyi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n) with xi\xe2\x89\xa0yixi\xe2\x89\xa0yi, indicating that there is a bidirectional road between city xixi and city yiyi. It is guaranteed that the given roads form a tree.'
b'Then the ii-th line of the following qq lines contains four integers uiui, vivi, lili, riri (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n), indicating the plan of the ii-th year.'
b'Output'
b'Print qq lines, the ii-th of which contains an integer cici such that '
b'  ci=\xe2\x88\x921ci=\xe2\x88\x921 if there is no such mineral resource that meets the required condition; or  cici is the label of the chosen mineral resource of the ii-th year. The chosen mineral resource cici should meet those conditions in the ii-th year described above in the problem statement. If there are multiple choices of cici, you can print any of them. '
