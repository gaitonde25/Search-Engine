b'In an unspecified solar system, there are NN planets. A space government company has recently hired space contractors to build MM bidirectional Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways, each connecting two different planets. The primary objective, which was to make sure that every planet can be reached from any other planet taking only Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways, has been completely fulfilled. Unfortunately, lots of space contractors had friends and cousins in the Space Board of Directors of the company, so the company decided to do much more than just connecting all planets. '
b'In order to make spending enormous amounts of space money for Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways look neccessary, they decided to enforce a strict rule on the Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highway network: whenever there is a way to travel through some planets and return to the starting point without travelling through any planet twice, every pair of planets on the itinerary should be directly connected by a Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highway. In other words, the set of planets in every simple cycle induces a complete subgraph.'
b'You are designing a Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 navigational app, and the key technical problem you are facing is finding the minimal number of Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways one needs to use to travel from planet AA to planet BB. As this problem is too easy for Bubble Cup, here is a harder task: your program needs to do it for QQ pairs of planets.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three positive integers NN (1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000), MM (1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45000001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4500000) and QQ (1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4200000), denoting the number of planets, the number of Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways, and the number of queries, respectively.'
b'Each of the following M lines contains a highway: highway ii is given by two integers uiui and vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui<vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4ui<vi\xe2\x89\xa4N), meaning the planets uiui and vivi are connected by a Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highway. It is guaranteed that the network of planets and Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways forms a simple connected graph.'
b'Each of the following QQ lines contains a query: query jj is given by two integers ajaj and bjbj (1\xe2\x89\xa4aj<bj\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4aj<bj\xe2\x89\xa4N), meaning we are interested in the minimal number of Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways one needs to take to travel from planet ajaj to planet bjbj.'
b'Output'
b'Output QQ lines: the jj-th line of output should contain the minimal number of Hyperspace\xe2\x84\xa2 highways one needs to take to travel from planet ajaj to planet bjbj.'
