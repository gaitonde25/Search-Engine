b'nn boys and mm girls came to the party. Each boy presented each girl some integer number of sweets (possibly zero). All boys are numbered with integers from 11 to nn and all girls are numbered with integers from 11 to mm. For all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n the minimal number of sweets, which ii-th boy presented to some girl is equal to bibi and for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m the maximal number of sweets, which jj-th girl received from some boy is equal to gjgj.'
b'More formally, let ai,jai,j be the number of sweets which the ii-th boy give to the jj-th girl. Then bibi is equal exactly to the minimum among values ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,mai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,m and gjgj is equal exactly to the maximum among values b1,j,b2,j,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn,jb1,j,b2,j,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn,j.'
b'You are interested in the minimum total number of sweets that boys could present, so you need to minimize the sum of ai,jai,j for all (i,j)(i,j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m. You are given the numbers b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn and g1,\xe2\x80\xa6,gmg1,\xe2\x80\xa6,gm, determine this number. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm, separated with space\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of boys and girls, respectively (2\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4100000). The second line contains nn integers b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn, separated by spaces\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 bibi is equal to the minimal number of sweets, which ii-th boy presented to some girl (0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41080\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4108). The third line contains mm integers g1,\xe2\x80\xa6,gmg1,\xe2\x80\xa6,gm, separated by spaces\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 gjgj is equal to the maximal number of sweets, which jj-th girl received from some boy (0\xe2\x89\xa4gj\xe2\x89\xa41080\xe2\x89\xa4gj\xe2\x89\xa4108).'
b'Output'
b'If the described situation is impossible, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921. In another case, print the minimal total number of sweets, which boys could have presented and all conditions could have satisfied.'
