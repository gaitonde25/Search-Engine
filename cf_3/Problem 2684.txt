b"We have three positive integers aa, bb and cc. You don't know their values, but you know some information about them. Consider all three pairwise sums, i.e. the numbers a+ba+b, a+ca+c and b+cb+c. You know exactly two (any) of three pairwise sums."
b'Your task is to find such three positive integers aa, bb and cc which match the given information. It means that if you consider a+ba+b, a+ca+c and b+cb+c, two out of all three of them are given in the input. Among all such triples, you must choose one with the minimum possible sum a+b+ca+b+c, and among all triples with the minimum sum, you can print any.'
b'You have to process qq independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'The next qq lines contain queries. Each query is given as two integers xx and yy (2\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851092\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109), where xx and yy are any two out of the three numbers a+ba+b, a+ca+c and b+cb+c.'
b'Output'
b'For each query print the answer to it: three positive integers aa, bb and cc consistent with the given information. Among all such triples, you have to choose one with the minimum possible sum a+b+ca+b+c. Among all triples with the minimum sum, you can print any.'
