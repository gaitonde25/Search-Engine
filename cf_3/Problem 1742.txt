b'You have to restore the wall. The wall consists of NN pillars of bricks, the height of the ii-th pillar is initially equal to hihi, the height is measured in number of bricks. After the restoration all the NN pillars should have equal heights.'
b'You are allowed the following operations:'
b' put a brick on top of one pillar, the cost of this operation is AA; remove a brick from the top of one non-empty pillar, the cost of this operation is RR; move a brick from the top of one non-empty pillar to the top of another pillar, the cost of this operation is MM.'
b'You cannot create additional pillars or ignore some of pre-existing pillars even if their height becomes 00.'
b'What is the minimal total cost of restoration, in other words, what is the minimal total cost to make all the pillars of equal height?'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains four integers NN, AA, RR, MM (1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4A,R,M\xe2\x89\xa41040\xe2\x89\xa4A,R,M\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of pillars and the costs of operations.'
b'The second line contains NN integers hihi (0\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 initial heights of pillars.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimal cost of restoration.'
