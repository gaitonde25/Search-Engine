b"Alice likes snow a lot! Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and she can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day i he will make a pile of snow of volume Vi and put it in her garden."
b'Each day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day is Ti, each pile will reduce its volume by Ti. If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other. '
b'Note that the pile made on day i already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.'
b'You are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer N (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89N\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of days. '
b'The second line contains N integers V1,\xe2\x80\x89V2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89VN (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89Vi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109), where Vi is the initial size of a snow pile made on the day i.'
b'The third line contains N integers T1,\xe2\x80\x89T2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89TN (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89Ti\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109), where Ti is the temperature on the day i.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single line with N integers, where the i-th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on day i.'
