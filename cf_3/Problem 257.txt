b'You are given mm arrays of positive integers. Each array is of even length.'
b'You need to split all these integers into two equal multisets LL and RR, that is, each element of each array should go into one of two multisets (but not both). Additionally, for each of the mm arrays, exactly half of its elements should go into LL, and the rest should go into RR.'
b'Give an example of such a division or determine that no such division exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of arrays.'
b'The next 2\xe2\x8b\x85m2\xe2\x8b\x85m lines contain descriptions of the arrays.'
b'For each array, the first line contains an even integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the array. The second line consists of nn space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 array elements.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all arrays does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'If the answer exists, print "YES", and then print mm lines.'
b'On each line, for each element, print the letter "L" or "R" (capitalized, without spaces), depending on which multiset the element should go into.'
b'If there is no answer, print "NO" on the only line.'
