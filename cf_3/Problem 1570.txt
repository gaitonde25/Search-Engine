b'Koa the Koala and her best friend want to play a game.'
b'The game starts with an array aa of length nn consisting of non-negative integers. Koa and her best friend move in turns and each have initially a score equal to 00. Koa starts.'
b"Let's describe a move in the game:"
b'  During his move, a player chooses any element of the array and removes it from this array, xor-ing it with the current score of the player. More formally: if the current score of the player is xx and the chosen element is yy, his new score will be x\xe2\x8a\x95yx\xe2\x8a\x95y. Here \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes bitwise XOR operation. Note that after a move element yy is removed from aa.  The game ends when the array is empty. '
b"At the end of the game the winner is the player with the maximum score. If both players have the same score then it's a draw."
b'If both players play optimally find out whether Koa will win, lose or draw the game.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains the integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of aa.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 elements of aa.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print:'
b'  WIN if Koa will win the game.  LOSE if Koa will lose the game.  DRAW if the game ends in a draw. '
