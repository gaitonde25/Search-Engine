b'A positive integer xx is called a power of two if it can be represented as x=2yx=2y, where yy is a non-negative integer. So, the powers of two are 1,2,4,8,16,\xe2\x80\xa61,2,4,8,16,\xe2\x80\xa6.'
b'You are given two positive integers nn and kk. Your task is to represent nn as the sum of exactly kk powers of two.'
b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to represent nn as the sum of kk powers of two, print NO.'
b'Otherwise, print YES, and then print kk positive integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bkb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bk such that each of bibi is a power of two, and \xe2\x88\x91i=1kbi=n\xe2\x88\x91i=1kbi=n. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.'
