b"Treeland consists of nn cities and n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 roads. Each road is bidirectional and connects two distinct cities. From any city you can get to any other city by roads. Yes, you are right \xe2\x80\x94 the country's topology is an undirected tree."
b'There are some private road companies in Treeland. The government decided to sell roads to the companies. Each road will belong to one company and a company can own multiple roads.'
b"The government is afraid to look unfair. They think that people in a city can consider them unfair if there is one company which owns two or more roads entering the city. The government wants to make such privatization that the number of such cities doesn't exceed kk and the number of companies taking part in the privatization is minimal."
b"Choose the number of companies rr such that it is possible to assign each road to one company in such a way that the number of cities that have two or more roads of one company is at most kk. In other words, if for a city all the roads belong to the different companies then the city is good. Your task is to find the minimal rr that there is such assignment to companies from 11 to rr that the number of cities which are not good doesn't exceed kk."
b"  The picture illustrates the first example (n=6,k=2n=6,k=2). The answer contains r=2r=2 companies. Numbers on the edges denote edge indices. Edge colors mean companies: red corresponds to the first company, blue corresponds to the second company. The gray vertex (number 33) is not good. The number of such vertices (just one) doesn't exceed k=2k=2. It is impossible to have at most k=2k=2 not good cities in case of one company. "
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9212\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities and the maximal number of cities which can have two or more roads belonging to one company.'
b'The following n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain roads, one road per line. Each line contains a pair of integers xixi, yiyi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n), where xixi, yiyi are cities connected with the ii-th road.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print the required rr (1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921). In the second line print n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 numbers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn\xe2\x88\x921c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn\xe2\x88\x921 (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4r1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4r), where cici is the company to own the ii-th road. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
