b'Businessman Divan loves chocolate! Today he came to a store to buy some chocolate. Like all businessmen, Divan knows the value of money, so he will not buy too expensive chocolate. At the same time, too cheap chocolate tastes bad, so he will not buy it as well.'
b'The store he came to has nn different chocolate bars, and the price of the ii-th chocolate bar is aiai dollars. Divan considers a chocolate bar too expensive if it costs strictly more than rr dollars. Similarly, he considers a bar of chocolate to be too cheap if it costs strictly less than ll dollars. Divan will not buy too cheap or too expensive bars.'
b'Divan is not going to spend all his money on chocolate bars, so he will spend at most kk dollars on chocolates.'
b'Please determine the maximum number of chocolate bars Divan can buy.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100). Description of the test cases follows.'
b"The description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains integers nn, ll, rr, kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the lowest acceptable price of a chocolate, the highest acceptable price of a chocolate and Divan's total budget, respectively."
