b"You've been in love with Coronavirus-chan for a long time, but you didn't know where she lived until now. And just now you found out that she lives in a faraway place called Naha. "
b"You immediately decided to take a vacation and visit Coronavirus-chan. Your vacation lasts exactly xx days and that's the exact number of days you will spend visiting your friend. You will spend exactly xx consecutive (successive) days visiting Coronavirus-chan."

b'The mood of Coronavirus-chan (and, accordingly, her desire to hug you) depends on the number of the day in a month. In particular, you get jj hugs if you visit Coronavirus-chan on the jj-th day of the month.'
