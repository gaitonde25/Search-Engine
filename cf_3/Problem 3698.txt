b'The Rebel fleet is afraid that the Empire might want to strike back again. Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths \xe2\x80\x93 from a base to its assigned spaceship \xe2\x80\x93 do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two space-separated integers R,\xe2\x80\x89B(1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89R,\xe2\x80\x89B\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910). For 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89R, the i\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|,\xe2\x80\x89|yi|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.'
b'Output'
b'If it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).'
