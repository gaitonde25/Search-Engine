b'A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings "z", "aaa", "aba", and "abccba" are palindromes, but "codeforces" and "ab" are not. You hate palindromes because they give you d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu.'
b"There is a string ss. You must insert exactly one character 'a' somewhere in ss. If it is possible to create a string that is not a palindrome, you should find one example. Otherwise, you should report that it is impossible."
b'For example, suppose s=s= "cbabc". By inserting an \'a\', you can create "acbabc", "cababc", "cbaabc", "cbabac", or "cbabca". However "cbaabc" is a palindrome, so you must output one of the other options.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The only line of each test case contains a string ss consisting of lowercase English letters.'
b'The total length of all strings does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, if there is no solution, output "NO".'
b'Otherwise, output "YES" followed by your constructed string of length |s|+1|s|+1 on the next line. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.'
b'You can print each letter of "YES" and "NO" in any case (upper or lower).'
