b'Old timers of Summer Informatics School can remember previous camps in which each student was given a drink of his choice on the vechorka (late-evening meal). Or may be the story was more complicated?'
b'There are nn students living in a building, and for each of them the favorite drink aiai is known. So you know nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an, where aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4k) is the type of the favorite drink of the ii-th student. The drink types are numbered from 11 to kk.'
b'There are infinite number of drink sets. Each set consists of exactly two portions of the same drink. In other words, there are kk types of drink sets, the jj-th type contains two portions of the drink jj. The available number of sets of each of the kk types is infinite.'
b'You know that students will receive the minimum possible number of sets to give all students exactly one drink. Obviously, the number of sets will be exactly \xe2\x8c\x88n2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n2\xe2\x8c\x89, where \xe2\x8c\x88x\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88x\xe2\x8c\x89 is xx rounded up.'
b"After students receive the sets, they will distribute their portions by their choice: each student will get exactly one portion. Note, that if nn is odd then one portion will remain unused and the students' teacher will drink it."
b'What is the maximum number of students that can get their favorite drink if \xe2\x8c\x88n2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88n2\xe2\x8c\x89 sets will be chosen optimally and students will distribute portions between themselves optimally?'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of students in the building and the number of different drinks.'
b"The next nn lines contain student's favorite drinks. The ii-th line contains a single integer from 11 to kk \xe2\x80\x94 the type of the favorite drink of the ii-th student."
b'Output'
b'Print exactly one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of students that can get a favorite drink.'
