b'You are given an undirected graph without self-loops or multiple edges which consists of nn vertices and mm edges. Also you are given three integers n1n1, n2n2 and n3n3.'
b'Can you label each vertex with one of three numbers 1, 2 or 3 in such way, that: '
b'  Each vertex should be labeled by exactly one number 1, 2 or 3;  The total number of vertices with label 1 should be equal to n1n1;  The total number of vertices with label 2 should be equal to n2n2;  The total number of vertices with label 3 should be equal to n3n3;  |colu\xe2\x88\x92colv|=1|colu\xe2\x88\x92colv|=1 for each edge (u,v)(u,v), where colxcolx is the label of vertex\xc2\xa0xx. '
b'If there are multiple valid labelings, print any of them.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000; 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices and edges in the graph.'
b"The second line contains three integers n1n1, n2n2 and n3n3 (0\xe2\x89\xa4n1,n2,n3\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4n1,n2,n3\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of labels 1, 2 and 3, respectively. It's guaranteed that n1+n2+n3=nn1+n2+n3=n."
b"Next mm lines contan description of edges: the ii-th line contains two integers uiui, vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n; ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi) \xe2\x80\x94 the vertices the ii-th edge connects. It's guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain self-loops or multiple edges."
b'Output'
b'If valid labeling exists then print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print string of length nn consisting of 1, 2 and 3. The ii-th letter should be equal to the label of the ii-th vertex.'
b'If there is no valid labeling, print "NO" (without quotes).'
