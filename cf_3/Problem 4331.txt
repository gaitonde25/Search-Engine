b'Sagheer is walking in the street when he comes to an intersection of two roads. Each road can be represented as two parts where each part has 3 lanes getting into the intersection (one for each direction) and 3 lanes getting out of the intersection, so we have 4 parts in total. Each part has 4 lights, one for each lane getting into the intersection (l \xe2\x80\x94 left, s \xe2\x80\x94 straight, r \xe2\x80\x94 right) and a light p for a pedestrian crossing. '
b'  '
b'An accident is possible if a car can hit a pedestrian. This can happen if the light of a pedestrian crossing of some part and the light of a lane that can get to or from that same part are green at the same time.'
b'Now, Sagheer is monitoring the configuration of the traffic lights. Your task is to help him detect whether an accident is possible.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order.'
b'Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p \xe2\x80\x94 for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light.'
b'Output'
b'On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise.'
