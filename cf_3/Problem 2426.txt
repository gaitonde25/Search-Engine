b'Andrew was very excited to participate in Olympiad of Metropolises. Days flew by quickly, and Andrew is already at the airport, ready to go home. He has nn rubles left, and would like to exchange them to euro and dollar bills. Andrew can mix dollar bills and euro bills in whatever way he wants. The price of one dollar is dd rubles, and one euro costs ee rubles.'
b'Recall that there exist the following dollar bills: 11, 22, 55, 1010, 2020, 5050, 100100, and the following euro bills\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 55, 1010, 2020, 5050, 100100, 200200 (note that, in this problem we do not consider the 500500 euro bill, it is hard to find such bills in the currency exchange points). Andrew can buy any combination of bills, and his goal is to minimize the total number of rubles he will have after the exchange.'
b'Help him\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 write a program that given integers nn, ee and dd, finds the minimum number of rubles Andrew can get after buying dollar and euro bills.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4108)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial sum in rubles Andrew has. '
b'The second line of the input contains one integer dd (30\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa410030\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the price of one dollar in rubles. '
b'The third line of the input contains integer ee (30\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa410030\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the price of one euro in rubles.'
b'Output'
b'Output one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of rubles Andrew can have after buying dollar and euro bills optimally.'
