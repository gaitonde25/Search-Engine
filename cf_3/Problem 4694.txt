b'Nick has n bottles of soda left after his birthday. Each bottle is described by two values: remaining amount of soda ai and bottle volume bi (ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89bi).'
b'Nick has decided to pour all remaining soda into minimal number of bottles, moreover he has to do it as soon as possible. Nick spends x seconds to pour x units of soda from one bottle to another.'
b"Nick asks you to help him to determine k \xe2\x80\x94 the minimal number of bottles to store all remaining soda and t \xe2\x80\x94 the minimal time to pour soda into k bottles. A bottle can't store more soda than its volume. All remaining soda should be saved."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains positive integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of bottles.'
b'The second line contains n positive integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100), where ai is the amount of soda remaining in the i-th bottle.'
b'The third line contains n positive integers b1,\xe2\x80\x89b2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89bn (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89bi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100), where bi is the volume of the i-th bottle.'
b'It is guaranteed that ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89bi for any i.'
b'Output'
b'The only line should contain two integers k and t, where k is the minimal number of bottles that can store all the soda and t is the minimal time to pour the soda into k bottles.'
