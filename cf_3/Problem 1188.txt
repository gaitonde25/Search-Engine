b'You are playing a new computer game in which you have to fight monsters. In a dungeon you are trying to clear, you met three monsters; the first of them has aa health points, the second has bb health points, and the third has cc.'
b"To kill the monsters, you can use a cannon that, when fired, deals 11 damage to the selected monster. Every 77-th (i.\xc2\xa0e. shots with numbers 77, 1414, 2121 etc.) cannon shot is enhanced and deals 11 damage to all monsters, not just one of them. If some monster's current amount of health points is 00, it can't be targeted by a regular shot and does not receive damage from an enhanced shot."
b'You want to pass the dungeon beautifully, i.\xc2\xa0e., kill all the monsters with the same enhanced shot (i.\xc2\xa0e. after some enhanced shot, the health points of each of the monsters should become equal to 00 for the first time). Each shot must hit a monster, i.\xc2\xa0e. each shot deals damage to at least one monster.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of a single line that contains three integers aa, bb and cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa41081\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4108) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of health points each monster has.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print YES if you can kill all the monsters with the same enhanced shot. Otherwise, print NO. You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).'
