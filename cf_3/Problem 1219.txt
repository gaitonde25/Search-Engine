b'You are given an undirected graph consisting of nn vertices and nn edges. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected (i.\xc2\xa0e. it is possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex) and there are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph.'
b'Your task is to calculate the number of simple paths of length at least 11 in the given graph. Note that paths that differ only by their direction are considered the same (i.\xc2\xa0e. you have to calculate the number of undirected paths). For example, paths [1,2,3][1,2,3] and [3,2,1][3,2,1] are considered the same.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Recall that a path in the graph is a sequence of vertices v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vkv1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk such that each pair of adjacent (consecutive) vertices in this sequence is connected by an edge. The length of the path is the number of edges in it. A simple path is such a path that all vertices in it are distinct.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of the test case contains one integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices (and the number of edges) in the graph.'
b'The next nn lines of the test case describe edges: edge ii is given as a pair of vertices uiui, vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi), where uiui and vivi are vertices the ii-th edge connects. For each pair of vertices (u,v)(u,v), there is at most one edge between uu and vv. There are no edges from the vertex to itself. So, there are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph. The graph is undirected, i.\xc2\xa0e. all its edges are bidirectional. The graph is connected, i.\xc2\xa0e. it is possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex by moving along the edges of the graph.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105 (\xe2\x88\x91n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\xe2\x88\x91n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer: the number of simple paths of length at least 11 in the given graph. Note that paths that differ only by their direction are considered the same (i.\xc2\xa0e. you have to calculate the number of undirected paths).'
