b'Mishka got a six-faced dice. It has integer numbers from 22 to 77 written on its faces (all numbers on faces are different, so this is an almost usual dice).'
b'Mishka wants to get exactly xx points by rolling his dice. The number of points is just a sum of numbers written at the topmost face of the dice for all the rolls Mishka makes.'
b"Mishka doesn't really care about the number of rolls, so he just wants to know any number of rolls he can make to be able to get exactly xx points for them. Mishka is very lucky, so if the probability to get xx points with chosen number of rolls is non-zero, he will be able to roll the dice in such a way. Your task is to print this number. It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists."
b'Mishka is also very curious about different number of points to score so you have to answer tt independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'Each of the next tt lines contains one integer each. The ii-th line contains one integer xixi (2\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of points Mishka wants to get.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt lines. In the ii-th line print the answer to the ii-th query (i.e. any number of rolls Mishka can make to be able to get exactly xixi points for them). It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.'
