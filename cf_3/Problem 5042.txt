b'There are n parliamentarians in Berland. They are numbered with integers from 1 to n. It happened that all parliamentarians with odd indices are Democrats and all parliamentarians with even indices are Republicans.'
b'New parliament assembly hall is a rectangle consisting of a\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89b chairs\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a rows of b chairs each. Two chairs are considered neighbouring if they share as side. For example, chair number 5 in row number 2 is neighbouring to chairs number 4 and 6 in this row and chairs with number 5 in rows 1 and 3. Thus, chairs have four neighbours in general, except for the chairs on the border of the hall'
b'We know that if two parliamentarians from one political party (that is two Democrats or two Republicans) seat nearby they spent all time discussing internal party issues.'
b'Write the program that given the number of parliamentarians and the sizes of the hall determine if there is a way to find a seat for any parliamentarian, such that no two members of the same party share neighbouring seats.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains three integers n, a and b (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910\xe2\x80\x89000, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of parliamentarians, the number of rows in the assembly hall and the number of seats in each row, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'If there is no way to assigns seats to parliamentarians in a proper way print -1.'
b'Otherwise print the solution in a lines, each containing b integers. The j-th integer of the i-th line should be equal to the index of parliamentarian occupying this seat, or 0 if this seat should remain empty. If there are multiple possible solution, you may print any of them.'
