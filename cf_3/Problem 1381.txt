b'Yura has been walking for some time already and is planning to return home. He needs to get home as fast as possible. To do this, Yura can use the instant-movement locations around the city.'
b"Let's represent the city as an area of n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n square blocks. Yura needs to move from the block with coordinates (sx,sy)(sx,sy) to the block with coordinates (fx,fy)(fx,fy). In one minute Yura can move to any neighboring by side block; in other words, he can move in four directions. Also, there are mm instant-movement locations in the city. Their coordinates are known to you and Yura. Yura can move to an instant-movement location in no time if he is located in a block with the same coordinate xx or with the same coordinate yy as the location."
b'Help Yura to find the smallest time needed to get home.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of the city and the number of instant-movement locations (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b"The next line contains four integers sxsx sysy fxfx fyfy\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of Yura's initial position and the coordinates of his home (1\xe2\x89\xa4sx,sy,fx,fy\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4sx,sy,fx,fy\xe2\x89\xa4n)."
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two integers xixi yiyi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of the ii-th instant-movement location (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'Output'
b'In the only line print the minimum time required to get home.'
