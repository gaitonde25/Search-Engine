'
b'Determine the entrance through which Allen will finally enter the fan zone.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of entrances.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of people in queues. These numbers do not include Allen.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of entrance that Allen will use.'
