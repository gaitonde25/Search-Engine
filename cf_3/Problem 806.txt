b"Anya came to her friend's birthday party. There are nn delicious sweets on a circle table (for convenience, we will number them from 11 to nn in clockwise direction). For each of the sweets, it is known whether Anya likes it or not. Anya decided that she should eat all the sweets that are on the table, and she likes them."
b'However, eating all the sweets in some random order is too boring. Therefore, Anya came up with a game that will make the process of eating sweets more interesting.'
b'The game is played according to the following rules:'
b'  if there are no sweets that Anya likes left on the table, then the game ends;  at the very beginning of the game, if there is at least one sweet on the table that Anya wants to eat, she eats the sweet number 11;  after Anya has eaten some sweet, she counts kk sweets clockwise, starting from the next sweet in the circle, and eats the kk-th sweet in the count (if there are less than kk sweets in the circle, some sweets can participate in the count more than once, and the last sweet in the count is picked). Obviously, the sweets that have already been eaten do not participate in the count. '
b'For example, let 66 sweets be arranged in a circle, Anya likes sweets 44, 55 and 66, k=4k=4. Then the game goes as follows:'
b'  initially there are sweets [1,2,3,4,5,6][1,2,3,4,5,6] on the table, Anya chooses the sweet number 11.  Anya eats the sweet number 11, after that, there are sweets [2,3,4,5,6][2,3,4,5,6] on the table. Anya counts 44 sweets, starting with the 22-nd sweet, and stops at the 55-th sweet.  Anya eats the 55-th sweet, after that, there are sweets [2,3,4,6][2,3,4,6] on the table. Anya counts 44 sweets, starting with the 66-th sweet, and stops at the 44-th sweet.  Anya eats the sweet number 44, after that, there are sweets [2,3,6][2,3,6] on the table. Anya counts 44 sweets, starting with the 66-th sweet, and stops at the 66-th sweet.  Anya eats the sweet number 66, after that, there are sweets [2,3][2,3] on the table. There are no sweets that Anya likes on the table, so the game ends. '
b'Your task is to calculate the number of sweets that Anya will eat.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of sweets and the parameter kk.'
b'The next line contains the string ss, where si=1si=1 if Anya likes ii-th sweet, and si=0si=0 otherwise.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 50005000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of sweets that Anya will eat.'
