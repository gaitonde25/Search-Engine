b'Alice and Bob decided to play one ultimate game. They have nn piles, the ii-th pile initially contain vivi chips. Alice selects a positive integer aa from interval [1,m][1,m], and Bob selects a number bb the same way. '
b'Then the game starts. In her turn, Alice can select any pile containing at least aa chips, and remove exactly aa chips from it. Similarly, in his turn, Bob can choose any pile with at least bb chips, and remove exactly bb chips from it. If a player cannot make a move, he or she loses. '
b'If both players play optimally, the outcome ultimately depends on the choice of aa and bb, and on the starting player. Consider a fixed pair (a,b)(a,b). There are four types of games: '
b'  Alice wins, regardless of who starts.  Bob wins, regardless of who starts.  If Alice starts, she wins. If Bob starts, he wins. We say that the first player wins.  If Alice starts, Bob wins. If Bob starts, Alice wins. We say that the second player wins. '
b'Among all choices of aa and bb (i.e. for each pair (a,b)(a,b) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4m), determine how many games are won by Alice (regardless of who starts), how many are won by Bob (regardless of who starts), how many are won by the first player, and how many are won by the second player. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100,1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of piles, and the upper bound on the number of chips allowed to be taken in one turn, respectively. '
b'The second line contains nn integers v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vnv1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vn (1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa41018)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the starting number of chips in each pile.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single line containing four integers wawa, wbwb, wfwf, wsws\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of games won by Alice, Bob, the first player, the second player, respectively. '
