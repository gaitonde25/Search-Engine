b'CFK sells chicken chunks in small and large portions. A small portion contains 3 chunks; a large one \xe2\x80\x94 7 chunks. Ivan wants to eat exactly x chunks. Now he wonders whether he can buy exactly this amount of chicken.'
b'Formally, Ivan wants to know if he can choose two non-negative integers a and b in such a way that a small portions and b large ones contain exactly x chunks.'
b'Help Ivan to answer this question for several values of x!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'The i-th of the following n lines contains one integer xi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89xi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of chicken chunks Ivan wants to eat.'
b'Output'
b'Print n lines, in i-th line output YES if Ivan can buy exactly xi chunks. Otherwise, print NO.'
