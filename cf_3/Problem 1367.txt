b'Nikola owns a large warehouse which is illuminated by NN light bulbs, numbered 11 to NN. At the exit of the warehouse, there are SS light switches, numbered 11 to SS. Each switch swaps the on/off state for some light bulbs, so if a light bulb is off, flipping the switch turns it on, and if the light bulb is on, flipping the switch turns it off.'
b"At the end of the day, Nikola wants to turn all the lights off. To achieve this, he will flip some of the light switches at the exit of the warehouse, but since Nikola is lazy, he wants to flip the _minimum_ number of switches required to turn all the lights off. Since Nikola was not able to calculate the minimum number of switches, he asked you to help him. During a period of DD days, Nikola noted which light bulbs were off and which were on at the end of each day. He wants you to tell him the minimum number of switches he needed to flip to turn all the lights off for each of the DD days or tell him that it's impossible."
b'Input'
b'First line contains three integers, NN, SS and DD (1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103, 1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4301\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa430, 1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xe2\x80\x93 representing number of light bulbs, the number of light switches, and the number of days respectively.'
b'The next SS lines contain the description of each light switch as follows: The first number in the line, CiCi (1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4N), represents the number of light bulbs for which the on/off state is swapped by light switch ii, the next CiCi numbers (sorted in increasing order) represent the indices of those light bulbs.'
b'The next DD lines contain the description of light bulbs for each day as follows: The first number in the line, TiTi (1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa4N), represents the number of light bulbs which are on at the end of day ii, the next TiTi numbers (sorted in increasing order) represent the indices of those light bulbs.'
b'Output'
b"Print DD lines, one for each day. In the ithith line, print the minimum number of switches that need to be flipped on day ii, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it's impossible to turn all the lights off."
