b'Ivan places knights on infinite chessboard. Initially there are nn knights. If there is free cell which is under attack of at least 44 knights then he places new knight in this cell. Ivan repeats this until there are no such free cells. One can prove that this process is finite. One can also prove that position in the end does not depend on the order in which new knights are placed.'
b'Ivan asked you to find initial placement of exactly nn knights such that in the end there will be at least \xe2\x8c\x8an210\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8an210\xe2\x8c\x8b knights.'
b'Input'
b'The only line of input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4103)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of knights in the initial placement.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn lines. Each line should contain 22 numbers xixi and yiyi (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of ii-th knight. For all i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j, (xi,yi)\xe2\x89\xa0(xj,yj)(xi,yi)\xe2\x89\xa0(xj,yj) should hold. In other words, all knights should be in different cells.'
b'It is guaranteed that the solution exists.'
