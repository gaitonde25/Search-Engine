b"You are given a bracket sequence ss consisting of nn opening '(' and closing ')' brackets."
b'A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \'1\' and \'+\' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)", "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(" and "(" are not.'
b"You can change the type of some bracket sisi. It means that if si=si= ')' then you can change it to '(' and vice versa."
b'Your task is to calculate the number of positions ii such that if you change the type of the ii-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the bracket sequence.'
b"The second line of the input contains the string ss consisting of nn opening '(' and closing ')' brackets."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of positions ii such that if you change the type of the ii-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.'
