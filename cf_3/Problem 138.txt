b'You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) the following inequality is true: \xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42.'
b'You can remove any number (possibly 00) of elements from the beginning of the array and any number (possibly 00) of elements from the end of the array. You are allowed to delete the whole array.'
b'You need to answer the question: how many elements should be removed from the beginning of the array, and how many elements should be removed from the end of the array, so that the result will be an array whose product (multiplication) of elements is maximal. If there is more than one way to get an array with the maximum product of elements on it, you are allowed to output any of them. '
b'The product of elements of an empty array (array of length 00) should be assumed to be 11.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input data contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94the number of test cases in the test.'
b'Then the descriptions of the input test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case description contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94the length of array aa.'
b'The next line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (|ai|\xe2\x89\xa42|ai|\xe2\x89\xa42)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 elements of array aa.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output two non-negative numbers xx and yy (0\xe2\x89\xa4x+y\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4x+y\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 such that the product (multiplication) of the array numbers, after removing xx elements from the beginning and yy elements from the end, is maximal.'
b'If there is more than one way to get the maximal product, it is allowed to output any of them. Consider the product of numbers on empty array to be 11.'
