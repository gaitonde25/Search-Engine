b'Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters \'A\' and \'B\'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "AB" or "BB". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.'
b'For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations: AABABBA \xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x86\x92 AABBA \xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x86\x92 AAA.'
b'Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa420000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa420000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.'
b"Each of the next tt lines contains a single test case each, consisting of a non-empty string ss: the string that Zookeeper needs to bomb. It is guaranteed that all symbols of ss are either 'A' or 'B'."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of |s||s| (length of ss) among all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single integer: the length of the shortest string that Zookeeper can make.'
