b'Joker returns to Gotham City to execute another evil plan. In Gotham City, there are NN street junctions (numbered from 11 to NN) and MM streets (numbered from 11 to MM). Each street connects two distinct junctions, and two junctions are connected by at most one street.'
b'For his evil plan, Joker needs to use an odd number of streets that together form a cycle. That is, for a junction SS and an even positive integer kk, there is a sequence of junctions S,s1,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk,SS,s1,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk,S such that there are streets connecting (a) SS and s1s1, (b) sksk and SS, and (c) si\xe2\x88\x921si\xe2\x88\x921 and sisi for each i=2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ki=2,\xe2\x80\xa6,k.'
b"However, the police are controlling the streets of Gotham City. On each day ii, they monitor a different subset of all streets with consecutive numbers jj: li\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4rili\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4ri. These monitored streets cannot be a part of Joker's plan, of course. Unfortunately for the police, Joker has spies within the Gotham City Police Department; they tell him which streets are monitored on which day. Now Joker wants to find out, for some given number of days, whether he can execute his evil plan. On such a day there must be a cycle of streets, consisting of an odd number of streets which are not monitored on that day."
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains three integers NN, MM, and QQ (1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4200000): the number of junctions, the number of streets, and the number of days to be investigated. The following MM lines describe the streets. The jj-th of these lines (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M) contains two junction numbers uu and vv (u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v), saying that street jj connects these two junctions. It is guaranteed that any two junctions are connected by at most one street. The following QQ lines contain two integers lili and riri, saying that all streets jj with li\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4rili\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4ri are checked by the police on day ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q).'
b'Output'
b'Your output is to contain QQ lines. Line ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q) contains "YES" if Joker can execute his plan on day ii, or "NO" otherwise.'
