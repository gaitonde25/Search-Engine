b"Vasya is a CEO of a big construction company. And as any other big boss he has a spacious, richly furnished office with two crystal chandeliers. To stay motivated Vasya needs the color of light at his office to change every day. That's why he ordered both chandeliers that can change its color cyclically. For example: red\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0brown\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0yellow\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0red\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0brown\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0yellow and so on. "
b'There are many chandeliers that differs in color set or order of colors. And the person responsible for the light made a critical mistake\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 they bought two different chandeliers.'
b'Since chandeliers are different, some days they will have the same color, but some days\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 different. Of course, it looks poor and only annoys Vasya. As a result, at the kk-th time when chandeliers will light with different colors, Vasya will become very angry and, most probably, will fire the person who bought chandeliers.'
b'Your task is to calculate the day, when it happens (counting from the day chandeliers were installed). You can think that Vasya works every day without weekends and days off.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, mm and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa45000001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4500000; 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410121\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41012)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of colors in the first and the second chandeliers and how many times colors should differ to anger Vasya.'
b"The second line contains nn different integers aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85max(n,m)1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85max(n,m)) that describe the first chandelier's sequence of colors."
b"The third line contains mm different integers bjbj (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85max(n,m)1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85max(n,m)) that describe the second chandelier's sequence of colors."
b'At the ii-th day, the first chandelier has a color axax, where x=((i\xe2\x88\x921)modn)+1)x=((i\xe2\x88\x921)modn)+1) and the second one has a color byby, where y=((i\xe2\x88\x921)modm)+1)y=((i\xe2\x88\x921)modm)+1).'
b"It's guaranteed that sequence aa differs from sequence bb, so there are will be days when colors of chandeliers differs."
b'Output'
b'Print the single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the index of day when Vasya will become angry.'
