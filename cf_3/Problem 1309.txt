b'You are given a matrix aa of size n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m consisting of integers.'
b'You can choose no more than \xe2\x8c\x8am2\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8am2\xe2\x8c\x8b elements in each row. Your task is to choose these elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by kk and this sum is the maximum.'
b'In other words, you can choose no more than a half (rounded down) of elements in each row, you have to find the maximum sum of these elements divisible by kk.'
b'Note that you can choose zero elements (and the sum of such set is 00).'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains three integers nn, mm and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,k\xe2\x89\xa4701\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,k\xe2\x89\xa470) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows in the matrix, the number of columns in the matrix and the value of kk. The next nn lines contain mm elements each, where the jj-th element of the ii-th row is ai,jai,j (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4701\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa470).'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum sum divisible by kk you can obtain.'
