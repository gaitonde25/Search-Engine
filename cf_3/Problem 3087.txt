b'A conglomerate consists of nn companies. To make managing easier, their owners have decided to merge all companies into one. By law, it is only possible to merge two companies, so the owners plan to select two companies, merge them into one, and continue doing so until there is only one company left.'
b'But anti-monopoly service forbids to merge companies if they suspect unfriendly absorption. The criterion they use is the difference in maximum salaries between two companies. Merging is allowed only if the maximum salaries are equal.'
b'To fulfill the anti-monopoly requirements, the owners can change salaries in their companies before merging. But the labor union insists on two conditions: it is only allowed to increase salaries, moreover all the employees in one company must get the same increase.'
b'Sure enough, the owners want to minimize the total increase of all salaries in all companies. Help them find the minimal possible increase that will allow them to merge companies into one.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of companies in the conglomerate (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105). Each of the next nn lines describes a company. '
b'A company description start with an integer mimi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of its employees (1\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4mi\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105). Then mimi integers follow: the salaries of the employees. All salaries are positive and do not exceed 109109. '
b'The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105. '
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimal total increase of all employees that allows to merge all companies.'
