b"It's hard times now. Today Petya needs to score 100 points on Informatics exam. The tasks seem easy to Petya, but he thinks he lacks time to finish them all, so he asks you to help with one.."
b'There is a glob pattern in the statements (a string consisting of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*"). It is known that character "*" occurs no more than once in the pattern.'
b'Also, n query strings are given, it is required to determine for each of them if the pattern matches it or not.'
b'Everything seemed easy to Petya, but then he discovered that the special pattern characters differ from their usual meaning.'
b'A pattern matches a string if it is possible to replace each character "?" with one good lowercase English letter, and the character "*" (if there is one) with any, including empty, string of bad lowercase English letters, so that the resulting string is the same as the given string.'
b'The good letters are given to Petya. All the others are bad.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a string with length from 1 to 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters. These letters are good letters, all the others are bad.'
b'The second line contains the pattern\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a string s of lowercase English letters, characters "?" and "*" (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|s|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105). It is guaranteed that character "*" occurs in s no more than once.'
b'The third line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of query strings.'
b'n lines follow, each of them contains single non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a query string.'
b'It is guaranteed that the total length of all query strings is not greater than 105.'
b'Output'
b'Print n lines: in the i-th of them print "YES" if the pattern matches the i-th query string, and "NO" otherwise.'
b'You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.'
