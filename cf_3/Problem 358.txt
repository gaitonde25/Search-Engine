b'Christmas is coming, Icy has just received a box of chocolates from her grandparents! The box contains nn chocolates. The ii-th chocolate has a non-negative integer type aiai.'
b'Icy believes that good things come in pairs. Unfortunately, all types of chocolates are distinct (all aiai are distinct). Icy wants to make at least one pair of chocolates the same type. '
b'As a result, she asks her grandparents to perform some chocolate exchanges. Before performing any chocolate exchanges, Icy chooses two chocolates with indices xx and yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n, x\xe2\x89\xa0yx\xe2\x89\xa0y).'
b"In a chocolate exchange, Icy's grandparents choose a non-negative integer kk, such that 2k\xe2\x89\xa5ax2k\xe2\x89\xa5ax, and change the type of the chocolate xx from axax to 2k\xe2\x88\x92ax2k\xe2\x88\x92ax (that is, perform ax:=2k\xe2\x88\x92axax:=2k\xe2\x88\x92ax)."
b'The chocolate exchanges will be stopped only when ax=ayax=ay. Note that other pairs of equal chocolate types do not stop the procedure.'
b"Icy's grandparents are smart, so they would choose the sequence of chocolate exchanges that minimizes the number of exchanges needed. Since Icy likes causing trouble, she wants to maximize the minimum number of exchanges needed by choosing xx and yy appropriately. She wonders what is the optimal pair (x,y)(x,y) such that the minimum number of exchanges needed is maximized across all possible choices of (x,y)(x,y)."
b'Since Icy is not good at math, she hopes that you can help her solve the problem.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of chocolates.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'It is guaranteed that all aiai are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'Output three integers xx, yy, and mm.'
b'xx and yy are indices of the optimal chocolates to perform exchanges on. Your output must satisfy 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n, x\xe2\x89\xa0yx\xe2\x89\xa0y.'
b'mm is the number of exchanges needed to obtain ax=ayax=ay. We can show that m\xe2\x89\xa4109m\xe2\x89\xa4109 for any pair of chocolates.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, output any.'
