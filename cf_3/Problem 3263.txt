b"Euler is a little, cute squirrel. When the autumn comes, he collects some reserves for winter. The interesting fact is that Euler likes to collect acorns in a specific way. A tree can be described as nn acorns connected by n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 branches, such that there is exactly one way between each pair of acorns. Let's enumerate the acorns from 11 to nn."
b'The squirrel chooses one acorn (not necessary with number 11) as a start, and visits them in a way called "Euler tour" (see notes), collecting each acorn when he visits it for the last time.'
b'Today morning Kate was observing Euler. She took a sheet of paper and wrote down consecutive indices of acorns on his path. Unfortunately, during her way to home it started raining and some of numbers became illegible. Now the girl is very sad, because she has to present the observations to her teacher.'
b'"Maybe if I guess the lacking numbers, I\'ll be able to do it!" she thought. Help her and restore any valid Euler tour of some tree or tell that she must have made a mistake.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105), denoting the number of acorns in the tree.'
b'The second line contains 2n\xe2\x88\x9212n\xe2\x88\x921 integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a2n\xe2\x88\x921a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a2n\xe2\x88\x921 (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the Euler tour of the tree that Kate wrote down. 00 means an illegible number, which has to be guessed.'
b'Output'
b'If there is no Euler tour satisfying the given description, output "no" in the first line.'
b'Otherwise, on the first line output "yes", and then in the second line print the Euler tour which satisfy the given description.'
b"Any valid Euler tour will be accepted, since the teacher doesn't know how exactly the initial tree looks."
