b'The only difference between the easy and the hard version is the limit to the number of queries.'
b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'There is an array aa of nn different numbers. In one query you can ask the position of the second maximum element in a subsegment a[l..r]a[l..r]. Find the position of the maximum element in the array in no more than 20 queries.'
b'A subsegment a[l..r]a[l..r] is all the elements al,al+1,...,aral,al+1,...,ar. After asking this subsegment you will be given the position of the second maximum from this subsegment in the whole array.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)(2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the array.'
