b'The mayor of the Central Town wants to modernize Central Street, represented in this problem by the (Ox)(Ox) axis.'
b'On this street, there are nn antennas, numbered from 11 to nn. The ii-th antenna lies on the position xixi and has an initial scope of sisi: it covers all integer positions inside the interval [xi\xe2\x88\x92si;xi+si][xi\xe2\x88\x92si;xi+si].'
b'It is possible to increment the scope of any antenna by 11, this operation costs 11 coin. We can do this operation as much as we want (multiple times on the same antenna if we want).'
b"To modernize the street, we need to make all integer positions from 11 to mm inclusive covered by at least one antenna. Note that it is authorized to cover positions outside [1;m][1;m], even if it's not required."
b'What is the minimum amount of coins needed to achieve this modernization?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4801\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa480 and n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4100\xc2\xa0000n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4100\xc2\xa0000).'
b'The ii-th of the next nn lines contains two integers xixi and sisi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4m and 0\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4m0\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4m).'
b'On each position, there is at most one antenna (values xixi are pairwise distinct).'
b'Output'
b'You have to output a single integer: the minimum amount of coins required to make all integer positions from 11 to mm inclusive covered by at least one antenna.'
