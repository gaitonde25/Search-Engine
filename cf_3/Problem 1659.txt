b"Let's denote the function f(s)f(s) that takes a string ss consisting of lowercase Latin letters and dots, and returns a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters as follows:"
b'  let rr be an empty string;  process the characters of ss from left to right. For each character cc, do the following: if cc is a lowercase Latin letter, append cc at the end of the string rr; otherwise, delete the last character from rr (if rr is empty before deleting the last character \xe2\x80\x94 the function crashes);  return rr as the result of the function. '
b"You are given two strings ss and tt. You have to delete the minimum possible number of characters from ss so that f(s)=tf(s)=t (and the function does not crash). Note that you aren't allowed to insert new characters into ss or reorder the existing ones."
b'Input'
b'The input consists of two lines: the first one contains ss \xe2\x80\x94 a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and dots, the second one contains tt \xe2\x80\x94 a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters (1\xe2\x89\xa4|t|\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4|t|\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa410000).'
b'Additional constraint on the input: it is possible to remove some number of characters from ss so that f(s)=tf(s)=t.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible number of characters you have to delete from ss so f(s)f(s) does not crash and returns tt as the result of the function.'
