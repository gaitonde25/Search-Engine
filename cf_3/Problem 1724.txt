b'You are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the Y gate (possibly with an extra global phase of \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921) or the sequence of Pauli Z and Pauli X gates (the Z gate applied first and the X gate applied second; possibly with an extra global phase of \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921). The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.'
b'Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return'
b'  0 if it was the Y gate,  1 if it was the \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92XZ gate,  2 if it was the \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92Y gate,  3 if it was the XZ gate. '
b'You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants at most three times.'
b'You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:'
b'namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;    operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {        // your code here    }}'
