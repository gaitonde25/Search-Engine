b"JATC's math teacher always gives the class some interesting math problems so that they don't get bored. Today the problem is as follows. Given an integer nn, you can perform the following operations zero or more times:"
b'  mul xx: multiplies nn by xx (where xx is an arbitrary positive integer).  sqrt: replaces nn with n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9an (to apply this operation, n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x9an must be an integer). '
b'You can perform these operations as many times as you like. What is the minimum value of nn, that can be achieved and what is the minimum number of operations, to achieve that minimum value?'
b'Apparently, no one in the class knows the answer to this problem, maybe you can help them?'
b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial number.'
b'Output'
b'Print two integers: the minimum integer nn that can be achieved using the described operations and the minimum number of operations required.'
