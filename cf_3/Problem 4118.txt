b"It's another Start[c]up, and that means there are T-shirts to order. In order to make sure T-shirts are shipped as soon as possible, we've decided that this year we're going to order all of the necessary T-shirts before the actual competition. The top C contestants are going to be awarded T-shirts, but we obviously don't know which contestants that will be. The plan is to get the T-Shirt sizes of all contestants before the actual competition, and then order enough T-shirts so that no matter who is in the top C we'll have T-shirts available in order to award them."
b'In order to get the T-shirt sizes of the contestants, we will send out a survey. The survey will allow contestants to either specify a single desired T-shirt size, or two adjacent T-shirt sizes. If a contestant specifies two sizes, it means that they can be awarded either size.'
b"As you can probably tell, this plan could require ordering a lot of unnecessary T-shirts. We'd like your help to determine the minimum number of T-shirts we'll need to order to ensure that we'll be able to award T-shirts no matter the outcome of the competition."
b'Input'
b'Input will begin with two integers N and C (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89N\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89C), the number of T-shirt sizes and number of T-shirts to be awarded, respectively.'
b'Following this is a line with 2\xc2\xb7N\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 integers, s1 through s2\xc2\xb7N\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89si\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89108). For odd i, si indicates the number of contestants desiring T-shirt size ((i\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891)\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x892). For even i, si indicates the number of contestants okay receiving either of T-shirt sizes (i\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x892) and (i\xe2\x80\x89/\xe2\x80\x892\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891). C will not exceed the total number of contestants.'
b'Output'
b'Print the minimum number of T-shirts we need to buy.'
