b'This is an interactive problem'
b'You are given a grid n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n, where nn is odd. Rows are enumerated from 11 to nn from up to down, columns are enumerated from 11 to nn from left to right. Cell, standing on the intersection of row xx and column yy, is denoted by (x,y)(x,y).'
b'Every cell contains 00 or 11. It is known that the top-left cell contains 11, and the bottom-right cell contains 00.'
b'We want to know numbers in all cells of the grid. To do so we can ask the following questions: '
b'"?? x1x1 y1y1 x2x2 y2y2", where 1\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4x2\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4x2\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4y1\xe2\x89\xa4y2\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4y1\xe2\x89\xa4y2\xe2\x89\xa4n, and x1+y1+2\xe2\x89\xa4x2+y2x1+y1+2\xe2\x89\xa4x2+y2. In other words, we output two different cells (x1,y1)(x1,y1), (x2,y2)(x2,y2) of the grid such that we can get from the first to the second by moving only to the right and down, and they aren\'t adjacent.'
b'As a response to such question you will be told if there exists a path between (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2), going only to the right or down, numbers in cells of which form a palindrome.'
b'For example, paths, shown in green, are palindromic, so answer for "?? 11 11 22 33" and "?? 11 22 33 33" would be that there exists such path. However, there is no palindromic path between (1,1)(1,1) and (3,1)(3,1).'
b'  '
b'Determine all cells of the grid by asking not more than n2n2 questions. It can be shown that the answer always exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains odd integer (3\xe2\x89\xa4n<503\xe2\x89\xa4n<50)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the side of the grid.'
