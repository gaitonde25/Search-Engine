b"Vanya smashes potato in a vertical food processor. At each moment of time the height of the potato in the processor doesn't exceed h and the processor smashes k centimeters of potato each second. If there are less than k centimeters remaining, than during this second processor smashes all the remaining potato."
b'Vanya has n pieces of potato, the height of the i-th piece is equal to ai. He puts them in the food processor one by one starting from the piece number 1 and finishing with piece number n. Formally, each second the following happens:'
b'  If there is at least one piece of potato remaining, Vanya puts them in the processor one by one, until there is not enough space for the next piece.  Processor smashes k centimeters of potato (or just everything that is inside). '
b'Provided the information about the parameter of the food processor and the size of each potato in a row, compute how long will it take for all the potato to become smashed.'
