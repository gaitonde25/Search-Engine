b'Roman planted a tree consisting of n vertices. Each vertex contains a lowercase English letter. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree, each of the n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 remaining vertices has a parent in the tree. Vertex is connected with its parent by an edge. The parent of vertex i is vertex pi, the parent index is always less than the index of the vertex (i.e., pi\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89i).'
b'The depth of the vertex is the number of nodes on the path from the root to v along the edges. In particular, the depth of the root is equal to 1.'
b'We say that vertex u is in the subtree of vertex v, if we can get from u to v, moving from the vertex to the parent. In particular, vertex v is in its subtree.'
b"Roma gives you m queries, the i-th of which consists of two numbers vi, hi. Let's consider the vertices in the subtree vi located at depth hi. Determine whether you can use the letters written at these vertices to make a string that is a palindrome. The letters that are written in the vertexes, can be rearranged in any order to make a palindrome, but all letters should be used."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n, m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89500\xe2\x80\x89000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of nodes in the tree and queries, respectively.'
b'The following line contains n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 integers p2,\xe2\x80\x89p3,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89pn \xe2\x80\x94 the parents of vertices from the second to the n-th (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89i).'
b'The next line contains n lowercase English letters, the i-th of these letters is written on vertex i.'
b'Next m lines describe the queries, the i-th line contains two numbers vi, hi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89vi,\xe2\x80\x89hi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) \xe2\x80\x94 the vertex and the depth that appear in the i-th query.'
b'Output'
b'Print m lines. In the i-th line print "Yes" (without the quotes), if in the i-th query you can make a palindrome from the letters written on the vertices, otherwise print "No" (without the quotes).'
