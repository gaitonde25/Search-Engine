b'You are given a string ss. You should answer nn queries. The ii-th query consists of integer kiki and string mimi. The answer for this query is the minimum length of such a string tt that tt is a substring of ss and mimi has at least kiki occurrences as a substring in tt.'
b'A substring of a string is a continuous segment of characters of the string.'
b'It is guaranteed that for any two queries the strings mimi from these queries are different. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The second line contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'Each of next nn lines contains an integer kiki (1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa4|s|)(1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa4|s|) and a non-empty string mimi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 parameters of the query with number ii, in this order.'
b"All strings in input consists of lowercase English letters. Sum of length of all strings in input doesn't exceed 105105. All mimi are distinct."
b'Output'
b'For each query output the answer for it in a separate line.'
b'If a string mimi occurs in ss less that kiki times, output -1.'
