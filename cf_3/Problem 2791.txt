b'Arkady bought an air ticket from a city A to a city C. Unfortunately, there are no direct flights, but there are a lot of flights from A to a city B, and from B to C.'
b'There are nn flights from A to B, they depart at time moments a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, ..., anan and arrive at B tata moments later.'
b'There are mm flights from B to C, they depart at time moments b1b1, b2b2, b3b3, ..., bmbm and arrive at C tbtb moments later.'
b'The connection time is negligible, so one can use the ii-th flight from A to B and the jj-th flight from B to C if and only if bj\xe2\x89\xa5ai+tabj\xe2\x89\xa5ai+ta.'
b'You can cancel at most kk flights. If you cancel a flight, Arkady can not use it.'
b'Arkady wants to be in C as early as possible, while you want him to be in C as late as possible. Find the earliest time Arkady can arrive at C, if you optimally cancel kk flights. If you can cancel kk or less flights in such a way that it is not possible to reach C at all, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains five integers nn, mm, tata, tbtb and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n+m1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n+m, 1\xe2\x89\xa4ta,tb\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ta,tb\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of flights from A to B, the number of flights from B to C, the flight time from A to B, the flight time from B to C and the number of flights you can cancel, respectively.'

b'Output'
b'If you can cancel kk or less flights in such a way that it is not possible to reach C at all, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'Otherwise print the earliest time Arkady can arrive at C if you cancel kk flights in such a way that maximizes this time.'
