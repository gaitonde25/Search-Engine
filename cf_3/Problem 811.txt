b'There are nn students in a university. The number of students is even. The ii-th student has programming skill equal to aiai. '
b'The coach wants to form n2n2 teams. Each team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team. Two students can form a team only if their skills are equal (otherwise they cannot understand each other and cannot form a team).'
b'Students can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.'
b'The coach wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly n2n2 teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to find this number.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of students. It is guaranteed that nn is even.'
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100), where aiai is the skill of the ii-th student.'
b'Output'
b'Print one number \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly n2n2 teams.'
