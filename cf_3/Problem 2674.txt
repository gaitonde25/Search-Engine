b'Nauuo is a girl who loves drawing circles.'
b'One day she has drawn a circle and wanted to draw a tree on it.'
b'The tree is a connected undirected graph consisting of nn nodes and n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 edges. The nodes are numbered from 11 to nn.'
b'Nauuo wants to draw a tree on the circle, the nodes of the tree should be in nn distinct points on the circle, and the edges should be straight without crossing each other.'
b'"Without crossing each other" means that every two edges have no common point or the only common point is an endpoint of both edges.'
b'Nauuo wants to draw the tree using a permutation of nn elements. A permutation of nn elements is a sequence of integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn in which every integer from 11 to nn appears exactly once.'
b'After a permutation is chosen Nauuo draws the ii-th node in the pipi-th point on the circle, then draws the edges connecting the nodes.'
b'The tree is given, Nauuo wants to know how many permutations are there so that the tree drawn satisfies the rule (the edges are straight without crossing each other). She only wants to know the answer modulo 998244353998244353, can you help her?'
b'It is obvious that whether a permutation is valid or not does not depend on which nn points on the circle are chosen.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of nodes in the tree.'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n), denoting there is an edge between uu and vv.'
b'It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'Output'
b'The output contains a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of permutations suitable to draw the given tree on a circle satisfying the rule, modulo 998244353998244353.'
