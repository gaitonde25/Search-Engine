b'nn towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from 11 to nn in clockwise order. In the ii-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of aiai minutes for each i\xe2\x88\x88[1,n]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,n].'
b'Each singer visited all nn towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the ii-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts aiai minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.'
b'Hence, for the ii-th singer, the concert in the ii-th town will last aiai minutes, in the (i+1)(i+1)-th town the concert will last 2\xe2\x8b\x85ai2\xe2\x8b\x85ai minutes, ..., in the ((i+k)modn+1)((i+k)modn+1)-th town the duration of the concert will be (k+2)\xe2\x8b\x85ai(k+2)\xe2\x8b\x85ai, ..., in the town ((i+n\xe2\x88\x922)modn+1)((i+n\xe2\x88\x922)modn+1) \xe2\x80\x94 n\xe2\x8b\x85ain\xe2\x8b\x85ai minutes.'
b'You are given an array of bb integer numbers, where bibi is the total duration of concerts in the ii-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers aa or say that it is impossible.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities. The second line contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the total duration of concerts in ii-th city.'
b'The sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer as follows:'
b'If there is no suitable sequence aa, print NO. Otherwise, on the first line print YES, on the next line print the sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an of nn integers, where aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) is the initial duration of repertoire of the ii-th singer. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
