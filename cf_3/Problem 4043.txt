b'n people are standing in a line to play table tennis. At first, the first two players in the line play a game. Then the loser goes to the end of the line, and the winner plays with the next person from the line, and so on. They play until someone wins k games in a row. This player becomes the winner.'
b'For each of the participants, you know the power to play table tennis, and for all players these values are different. In a game the player with greater power always wins. Determine who will be the winner.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers: n and k (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89500, 2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891012)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of people and the number of wins.'
b"The second line contains n integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) \xe2\x80\x94 powers of the player. It's guaranteed that this line contains a valid permutation, i.e. all ai are distinct."
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 power of the winner.'
