b"Codeforces user' handle color depends on his rating\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 it is red if his rating is greater or equal to 2400; it is orange if his rating is less than 2400 but greater or equal to 2200, etc. Each time participant takes part in a rated contest, his rating is changed depending on his performance."
b'Anton wants the color of his handle to become red. He considers his performance in the rated contest to be good if he outscored some participant, whose handle was colored red before the contest and his rating has increased after it.'
b'Anton has written a program that analyses contest results and determines whether he performed good or not. Are you able to do the same?'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of participants Anton has outscored in this contest .'
b"The next n lines describe participants results: the i-th of them consists of a participant handle namei and two integers beforei and afteri (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x894000\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89beforei,\xe2\x80\x89afteri\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x894000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 participant's rating before and after the contest, respectively. Each handle is a non-empty string, consisting of no more than 10 characters, which might be lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, characters \xc2\xab_\xc2\xbb and \xc2\xab-\xc2\xbb characters."
b'It is guaranteed that all handles are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'Print \xc2\xabYES\xc2\xbb (quotes for clarity), if Anton has performed good in the contest and \xc2\xabNO\xc2\xbb (quotes for clarity) otherwise.'
