b'There are nn candies put from left to right on a table. The candies are numbered from left to right. The ii-th candy has weight wiwi. Alice and Bob eat candies. '
b"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). "
b"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). "
b"Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)."
b'They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies. What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies on the table.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers w1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wnw1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wn (1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the weights of candies from left to right.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.'
