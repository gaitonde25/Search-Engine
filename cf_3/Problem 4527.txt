b"Jon fought bravely to rescue the wildlings who were attacked by the white-walkers at Hardhome. On his arrival, Sam tells him that he wants to go to Oldtown to train at the Citadel to become a maester, so he can return and take the deceased Aemon's place as maester of Castle Black. Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. "
b'Initially Sam has a list with a single element n. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element x, such that x\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x891, from the list and insert at the same position , ,  sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1.'
b'Now the masters want the total number of 1s in the range l to r (1-indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you help Sam to pass the eligibility test?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers n, l, r (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89250, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89r\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105, r\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x891, l\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\x891) \xe2\x80\x93 initial element and the range l to r.'
b'It is guaranteed that r is not greater than the length of the final list.'
b'Output'
b'Output the total number of 1s in the range l to r in the final sequence.'
