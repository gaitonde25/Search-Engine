b'Not so long ago, Vlad had a birthday, for which he was presented with a package of candies. There were nn types of candies, there are aiai candies of the type ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'Vlad decided to eat exactly one candy every time, choosing any of the candies of a type that is currently the most frequent (if there are several such types, he can choose any of them). To get the maximum pleasure from eating, Vlad does not want to eat two candies of the same type in a row.'
b'Help him figure out if he can eat all the candies without eating two identical candies in a row.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input data contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of input test cases.'
b'The following is a description of tt test cases of input, two lines for each.'
b'The first line of the case contains the single number nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of types of candies in the package.'
b'The second line of the case contains nn integers aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies of the type ii.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn for all cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'Output tt lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case of input. As an answer, output "YES" if Vlad can eat candy as planned, and "NO" otherwise.'
b'You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).'
