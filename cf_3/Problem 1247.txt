b'To help those contestants who struggle a lot in contests, the headquarters of Codeforces are planning to introduce Division 5. In this new division, the tags of all problems will be announced prior to the round to help the contestants.'
b'The contest consists of nn problems, where the tag of the ii-th problem is denoted by an integer aiai.'
b'You want to AK (solve all problems). To do that, you must solve the problems in some order. To make the contest funnier, you created extra limitations on yourself. You do not want to solve two problems consecutively with the same tag since it is boring. Also, you are afraid of big jumps in difficulties while solving them, so you want to minimize the number of times that you solve two problems consecutively that are not adjacent in the contest order.'
b'Formally, your solve order can be described by a permutation pp of length nn. The cost of a permutation is defined as the number of indices ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n) where |pi+1\xe2\x88\x92pi|>1|pi+1\xe2\x88\x92pi|>1. You have the requirement that api\xe2\x89\xa0api+1api\xe2\x89\xa0api+1 for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n.'
b'You want to know the minimum possible cost of permutation that satisfies the requirement. If no permutations meet this requirement, you should report about it.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of problems in the contest.'
b'The next line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the tags of the problems.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, if there are no permutations that satisfy the required condition, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921. Otherwise, print the minimum possible cost of a permutation that satisfies the required condition.'
