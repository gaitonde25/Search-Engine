b'Polycarp has guessed three positive integers aa, bb and cc. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order \xe2\x80\x94 their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: a+ba+b, a+ca+c, b+cb+c and a+b+ca+b+c.'
b'You have to guess three numbers aa, bb and cc using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.'
b'Pay attention that some given numbers aa, bb and cc can be equal (it is also possible that a=b=ca=b=c).'
b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains four positive integers x1,x2,x3,x4x1,x2,x3,x4 (2\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 numbers written on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number x1,x2,x3,x4x1,x2,x3,x4.'
b'Output'
b'Print such positive integers aa, bb and cc that four numbers written on a board are values a+ba+b, a+ca+c, b+cb+c and a+b+ca+b+c written in some order. Print aa, bb and cc in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.'
