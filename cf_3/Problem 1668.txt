b'Ridhiman challenged Ashish to find the maximum valued subsequence of an array aa of size nn consisting of positive integers. '
b'The value of a non-empty subsequence of kk elements of aa is defined as \xe2\x88\x912i\xe2\x88\x912i over all integers i\xe2\x89\xa50i\xe2\x89\xa50 such that at least max(1,k\xe2\x88\x922)max(1,k\xe2\x88\x922) elements of the subsequence have the ii-th bit set in their binary representation (value xx has the ii-th bit set in its binary representation if \xe2\x8c\x8ax2i\xe2\x8c\x8bmod2\xe2\x8c\x8ax2i\xe2\x8c\x8bmod2 is equal to 11). '
b'Recall that bb is a subsequence of aa, if bb can be obtained by deleting some(possibly zero) elements from aa.'
b'Help Ashish find the maximum value he can get by choosing some subsequence of aa.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input consists of a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of aa.'
b'The next line consists of nn space-separated integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41018)(1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41018).'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum value Ashish can get by choosing some subsequence of aa.'
