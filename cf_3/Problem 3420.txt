b'John Smith knows that his son, Thomas Smith, is among the best students in his class and even in his school. After the students of the school took the exams in English, German, Math, and History, a table of results was formed.'
b"There are nn students, each of them has a unique id (from 11 to nn). Thomas's id is 11. Every student has four scores correspond to his or her English, German, Math, and History scores. The students are given in order of increasing of their ids."
