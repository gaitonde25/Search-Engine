b'Please pay attention to the unusual memory limit in this problem.'
b'In a parallel universe, Satan is called "Trygub". For that reason, the letters of his namesake were deleted from the alphabet in ancient times.'
b'The government has nn workers standing in a row and numbered with integers from 11 to nn from left to right. Their job categories can be represented as a string ss of length nn, where the character sisi represents the job category of the ii-th worker.'
b'A new law will be approved to increase the equality between the workers. The government decided to make everyone have the same job category by performing the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).'
b'There is a fixed rational parameter k=abk=ab describing how easy it is to convince the public, and it will be used to determine the success of an operation.'
b'In an operation, the government first selects a job category xx with at least one worker at the current moment. Suppose i1,\xe2\x80\xa6,imi1,\xe2\x80\xa6,im (i1<\xe2\x80\xa6<imi1<\xe2\x80\xa6<im) are the positions of all the workers with job category xx. If k\xe2\x8b\x85(im\xe2\x88\x92i1+1)\xe2\x89\xa4mk\xe2\x8b\x85(im\xe2\x88\x92i1+1)\xe2\x89\xa4m, the government is able to choose any job category yy with at least one worker at the current moment and change the job category of all workers with job category xx to job category yy.'
b'If it is possible to make all workers have job category xx, we say that xx is obtainable. Can you tell the government the set of obtainable job categories?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers n,a,bn,a,b (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of workers and the numerator and denominator of the parameter kk, respectively.'
b"The second line contains a string ss of length nn, consisting of lowercase English characters \xe2\x80\x94 the job categories of each worker. The characters 't', 'r', 'y', 'g', 'u', and 'b' do not appear in the string ss."
b'Output'
b'Print an integer cc equal to the number of obtainable job categories followed by cc space-separated characters\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the obtainable job categories sorted in the lexicographical order.'
