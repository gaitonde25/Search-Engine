b'DLS and JLS are bored with a Math lesson. In order to entertain themselves, DLS took a sheet of paper and drew nn distinct lines, given by equations y=x+piy=x+pi for some distinct p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn.'
b'Then JLS drew on the same paper sheet mm distinct lines given by equations y=\xe2\x88\x92x+qiy=\xe2\x88\x92x+qi for some distinct q1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qmq1,q2,\xe2\x80\xa6,qm.'
b'DLS and JLS are interested in counting how many line pairs have integer intersection points, i.e. points with both coordinates that are integers. Unfortunately, the lesson will end up soon, so DLS and JLS are asking for your help.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000), the number of test cases in the input. Then follow the test case descriptions.'
b'The first line of a test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105), the number of lines drawn by DLS.'
b'The second line of a test case contains nn distinct integers pipi (0\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4109) describing the lines drawn by DLS. The integer pipi describes a line given by the equation y=x+piy=x+pi.'
b'The third line of a test case contains an integer mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4105), the number of lines drawn by JLS.'
b'The fourth line of a test case contains mm distinct integers qiqi (0\xe2\x89\xa4qi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4qi\xe2\x89\xa4109) describing the lines drawn by JLS. The integer qiqi describes a line given by the equation y=\xe2\x88\x92x+qiy=\xe2\x88\x92x+qi.'
b'The sum of the values of nn over all test cases in the input does not exceed 105105. Similarly, the sum of the values of mm over all test cases in the input does not exceed 105105.'
b'In hacks it is allowed to use only one test case in the input, so t=1t=1 should be satisfied.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case in the input print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of line pairs with integer intersection points. '
