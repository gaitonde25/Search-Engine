b'After a drawn-out mooclear arms race, Farmer John and the Mischievous Mess Makers have finally agreed to establish peace. They plan to divide the territory of Bovinia with a line passing through at least two of the n outposts scattered throughout the land. These outposts, remnants of the conflict, are located at the points (x1,\xe2\x80\x89y1),\xe2\x80\x89(x2,\xe2\x80\x89y2),\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89(xn,\xe2\x80\x89yn).'
b"In order to find the optimal dividing line, Farmer John and Elsie have plotted a map of Bovinia on the coordinate plane. Farmer John's farm and the Mischievous Mess Makers' base are located at the points P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89(a,\xe2\x80\x890) and Q\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89(\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x890), respectively. Because they seek a lasting peace, Farmer John and Elsie would like to minimize the maximum difference between the distances from any point on the line to P and Q."
b'Formally, define the difference of a line  relative to two points P and Q as the smallest real number d so that for all points X on line , |PX\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89QX|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89d. (It is guaranteed that d exists and is unique.) They wish to find the line  passing through two distinct outposts (xi,\xe2\x80\x89yi) and (xj,\xe2\x80\x89yj) such that the difference of  relative to P and Q is minimized.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers n and a (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of outposts and the coordinates of the farm and the base, respectively.'
b'The following n lines describe the locations of the outposts as pairs of integers (xi,\xe2\x80\x89yi) (|xi|,\xe2\x80\x89|yi|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910\xe2\x80\x89000). These points are distinct from each other as well as from P and Q.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single real number\xe2\x80\x94the difference of the optimal dividing line. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x896. '
b"Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if ."
