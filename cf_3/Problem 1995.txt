b'This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543'
b'You run a string shop. During a day your customers want to buy strings of certain lengths and sometimes satisfying other properties.'
b'Today your first customer asked you if you have a string of length kk. In fact, you have a string of length nn and can cut a string of length kk starting at any position out of it. You wonder how many distinct values this string can equal.'
b'Please note that in your shop strings are over an alphabet of size 22.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000). The second line contains a binary string ss of length nn.'
b'Output'
b'In the only line print the number of distinct substrings of length kk of the string ss.'
