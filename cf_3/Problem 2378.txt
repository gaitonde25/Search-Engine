b'You have a fence consisting of nn vertical boards. The width of each board is 11. The height of the ii-th board is aiai. You think that the fence is great if there is no pair of adjacent boards having the same height. More formally, the fence is great if and only if for all indices from 22 to nn, the condition ai\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa0aiai\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa0ai holds.'
b'Unfortunately, it is possible that now your fence is not great. But you can change it! You can increase the length of the ii-th board by 11, but you have to pay bibi rubles for it. The length of each board can be increased any number of times (possibly, zero).'
b'Calculate the minimum number of rubles you have to spend to make the fence great again!'
b'You have to answer qq independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'The first line of each query contains one integers nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of boards in the fence.'
b'The following nn lines of each query contain the descriptions of the boards. The ii-th line contains two integers aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the ii-th board and the price for increasing it by 11, respectively.'
b'It is guaranteed that sum of all nn over all queries not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'It is guaranteed that answer to each query will not exceed 10181018.'
b'Output'
b'For each query print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of rubles you have to spend to make the fence great.'
