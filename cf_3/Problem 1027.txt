b"You have a deck of nn cards, and you'd like to reorder it to a new one."
b'Each card has a value between 11 and nn equal to pipi. All pipi are pairwise distinct. Cards in a deck are numbered from bottom to top, i.\xc2\xa0e. p1p1 stands for the bottom card, pnpn is the top card. '
b'In each step you pick some integer k>0k>0, take the top kk cards from the original deck and place them, in the order they are now, on top of the new deck. You perform this operation until the original deck is empty. (Refer to the notes section for the better understanding.)'
b"Let's define an order of a deck as \xe2\x88\x91i=1nnn\xe2\x88\x92i\xe2\x8b\x85pi\xe2\x88\x91i=1nnn\xe2\x88\x92i\xe2\x8b\x85pi."
b'Given the original deck, output the deck with maximum possible order you can make using the operation above.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains the single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of deck you have.'
b'The second line contains nn integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4n; pi\xe2\x89\xa0pjpi\xe2\x89\xa0pj if i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 values of card in the deck from bottom to top.'
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case print the deck with maximum possible order. Print values of cards in the deck from bottom to top.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
