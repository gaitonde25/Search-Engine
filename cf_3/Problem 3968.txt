b"A correct expression of the form a+b=c was written; a, b and c are non-negative integers without leading zeros. In this expression, the plus and equally signs were lost. The task is to restore the expression. In other words, one character '+' and one character '=' should be inserted into given sequence of digits so that: "
b"  character'+' is placed on the left of character '=',  characters '+' and '=' split the sequence into three non-empty subsequences consisting of digits (let's call the left part a, the middle part\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 b and the right part\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 c),  all the three parts a, b and c do not contain leading zeros,  it is true that a+b=c. "
b'It is guaranteed that in given tests answer always exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a non-empty string consisting of digits. The length of the string does not exceed 106.'
b'Output'
b'Output the restored expression. If there are several solutions, you can print any of them.'
b"Note that the answer at first should contain two terms (divided with symbol '+'), and then the result of their addition, before which symbol'=' should be. "
b'Do not separate numbers and operation signs with spaces. Strictly follow the output format given in the examples.'
b"If you remove symbol '+' and symbol '=' from answer string you should get a string, same as string from the input data."
