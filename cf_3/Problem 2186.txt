b'Bob is a competitive programmer. He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked nn of them how much effort they needed to reach red.'
b'"Oh, I just spent xixi hours solving problems", said the ii-th of them. '
b'Bob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of minutes (60\xe2\x8b\x85xi60\xe2\x8b\x85xi), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes \xe2\x80\x94 for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent 22 hours, Bob could write 000120000120 instead of 120120.'
b'Alice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently: '
b'  rearranged its digits, or  wrote a random number. '
b'This way, Alice generated nn numbers, denoted y1y1, ..., ynyn.'
b'For each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether yiyi can be a permutation of a number divisible by 6060 (possibly with leading zeroes).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa44181\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4418)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of grandmasters Bob asked.'
b'Then nn lines follow, the ii-th of which contains a single integer yiyi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number that Alice wrote down.'
b"Each of these numbers has between 22 and 100100 digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes."
b'Output'
b'Output nn lines.'
b'For each ii, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of yiyi such that the resulting number is divisible by 6060, output "red" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output "cyan".'
