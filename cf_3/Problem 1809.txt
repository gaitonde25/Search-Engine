b'You are given an array aa consisting of nn elements. You may apply several operations (possibly zero) to it.'
b'During each operation, you choose two indices ii and jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n; i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0j), increase ajaj by aiai, and remove the ii-th element from the array (so the indices of all elements to the right to it decrease by 11, and nn also decreases by 11).'
b'Your goal is to make the array aa strictly ascending. That is, the condition a1<a2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<ana1<a2<\xe2\x8b\xaf<an should hold (where nn is the resulting size of the array).'
b'Calculate the minimum number of actions required to make the array strictly ascending.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4151\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa415) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the initial array aa.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4106).'
b'It is guaranteed that: '
b'  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa55n\xe2\x89\xa55 is not greater than 50005000;  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa58n\xe2\x89\xa58 is not greater than 500500;  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa510n\xe2\x89\xa510 is not greater than 100100;  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa511n\xe2\x89\xa511 is not greater than 5050;  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa512n\xe2\x89\xa512 is not greater than 2525;  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa513n\xe2\x89\xa513 is not greater than 1010;  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa514n\xe2\x89\xa514 is not greater than 33;  the number of test cases having n\xe2\x89\xa515n\xe2\x89\xa515 is not greater than 11. '
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer as follows:'
b'In the first line, print kk \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations you have to perform. Then print kk lines, each containing two indices ii and jj for the corresponding operation. Note that the numeration of elements in the array changes after removing elements from it. If there are multiple optimal sequences of operations, print any one of them.'
