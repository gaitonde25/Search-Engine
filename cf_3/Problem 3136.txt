b'On his free time, Chouti likes doing some housework. He has got one new task, paint some bricks in the yard.'
b'There are nn bricks lined in a row on the ground. Chouti has got mm paint buckets of different colors at hand, so he painted each brick in one of those mm colors.'
b'Having finished painting all bricks, Chouti was satisfied. He stood back and decided to find something fun with these bricks. After some counting, he found there are kk bricks with a color different from the color of the brick on its left (the first brick is not counted, for sure).'
b'So as usual, he needs your help in counting how many ways could he paint the bricks. Two ways of painting bricks are different if there is at least one brick painted in different colors in these two ways. Because the answer might be quite big, you only need to output the number of ways modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'Input'
b'The first and only line contains three integers nn, mm and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42000,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42000,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of bricks, the number of colors, and the number of bricks, such that its color differs from the color of brick to the left of it.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to color bricks modulo 998244353998244353.'
