b'Polycarp lives on the coordinate axis OxOx and travels from the point x=ax=a to x=bx=b. It moves uniformly rectilinearly at a speed of one unit of distance per minute.'
b'On the axis OxOx at the point x=cx=c the base station of the mobile operator is placed. It is known that the radius of its coverage is rr. Thus, if Polycarp is at a distance less than or equal to rr from the point x=cx=c, then he is in the network coverage area, otherwise\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 no. The base station can be located both on the route of Polycarp and outside it.'
b'Print the time in minutes during which Polycarp will not be in the coverage area of the network, with a rectilinear uniform movement from x=ax=a to x=bx=b. His speed\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 one unit of distance per minute.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a positive integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. In the following lines are written tt test cases.'
b'The description of each test case is one line, which contains four integers aa, bb, cc and rr (\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4108\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4108, 0\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa41080\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4108)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the starting and ending points of the path, the base station, and its coverage radius, respectively.'
b'Any of the numbers aa, bb and cc can be equal (either any pair or all three numbers). The base station can be located both on the route of Polycarp and outside it.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt numbers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 answers to given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of minutes during which Polycarp will be unavailable during his movement.'
