b'Polycarp has decided to do a problemsolving marathon. He wants to solve ss problems in nn days. Let aiai be the number of problems he solves during the ii-th day. He wants to find a distribution of problems into days such that: '
b'  aiai is an integer value for all ii from 11 to nn;  ai\xe2\x89\xa51ai\xe2\x89\xa51 for all ii from 11 to nn;  ai+1\xe2\x89\xa5aiai+1\xe2\x89\xa5ai for all ii from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921;  ai+1\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85aiai+1\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85ai for all ii from 11 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921;  anan is maximized. '
b'Note that a1a1 can be arbitrarily large.'
b'What is the largest value of anan Polycarp can obtain?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'Then the descriptions of tt testcases follow.'
b'The only line of each testcase contains two integers nn and ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa41018)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of days and the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve.'
b"It's guaranteed that the distribution always exists within the given constraints."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum value of anan.'
