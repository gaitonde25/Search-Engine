b"You are given a tree (a graph with n vertices and n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 edges in which it's possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex using only its edges)."
b'A vertex can be destroyed if this vertex has even degree. If you destroy a vertex, all edges connected to it are also deleted.'
b'Destroy all vertices in the given tree or determine that it is impossible.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of vertices in a tree.'
b'The second line contains n integers p1,\xe2\x80\x89p2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89pn (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n). If pi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x890 there is an edge between vertices i and pi. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.'
b'Output'
b'If it\'s possible to destroy all vertices, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).'
b"If it's possible to destroy all vertices, in the next n lines print the indices of the vertices in order you destroy them. If there are multiple correct answers, print any."
