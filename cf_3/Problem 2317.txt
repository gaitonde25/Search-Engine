b"Ivan plays an old action game called Heretic. He's stuck on one of the final levels of this game, so he needs some help with killing the monsters."
b"The main part of the level is a large corridor (so large and narrow that it can be represented as an infinite coordinate line). The corridor is divided into two parts; let's assume that the point x=0x=0 is where these parts meet."
b'The right part of the corridor is filled with nn monsters \xe2\x80\x94 for each monster, its initial coordinate xixi is given (and since all monsters are in the right part, every xixi is positive).'
b'The left part of the corridor is filled with crusher traps. If some monster enters the left part of the corridor or the origin (so, its current coordinate becomes less than or equal to 00), it gets instantly killed by a trap.'
b"The main weapon Ivan uses to kill the monsters is the Phoenix Rod. It can launch a missile that explodes upon impact, obliterating every monster caught in the explosion and throwing all other monsters away from the epicenter. Formally, suppose that Ivan launches a missile so that it explodes in the point cc. Then every monster is either killed by explosion or pushed away. Let some monster's current coordinate be yy, then:"
b'  if c=yc=y, then the monster is killed;  if y<cy<c, then the monster is pushed rr units to the left, so its current coordinate becomes y\xe2\x88\x92ry\xe2\x88\x92r;  if y>cy>c, then the monster is pushed rr units to the right, so its current coordinate becomes y+ry+r. '
b'Ivan is going to kill the monsters as follows: choose some integer point dd and launch a missile into that point, then wait until it explodes and all the monsters which are pushed to the left part of the corridor are killed by crusher traps, then, if at least one monster is still alive, choose another integer point (probably the one that was already used) and launch a missile there, and so on.'
b'What is the minimum number of missiles Ivan has to launch in order to kill all of the monsters? You may assume that every time Ivan fires the Phoenix Rod, he chooses the impact point optimally.'
b'You have to answer qq independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'The first line of each query contains two integers nn and rr (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,r\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,r\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of enemies and the distance that the enemies are thrown away from the epicenter of the explosion.'
b'The second line of each query contains nn integers xixi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial positions of the monsters.'
b'It is guaranteed that sum of all nn over all queries does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each query print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of shots from the Phoenix Rod required to kill all monsters.'
