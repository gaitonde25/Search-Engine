b'You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B.'
b'A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest".'
b'A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward.'
b'The length of string B should be at most 104. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string.'
b'You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 104.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains a string A (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|A|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89103) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where |A| is a length of A.'
b'Output'
b'Output single line containing B consisting of only lowercase Latin letters. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 104. If there are many possible B, print any of them.'
