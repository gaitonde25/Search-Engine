b'Polycarp wants to assemble his own keyboard. Layouts with multiple rows are too complicated for him \xe2\x80\x94 his keyboard will consist of only one row, where all 2626 lowercase Latin letters will be arranged in some order.'
b"Polycarp uses the same password ss on all websites where he is registered (it is bad, but he doesn't care). He wants to assemble a keyboard that will allow to type this password very easily. He doesn't like to move his fingers while typing the password, so, for each pair of adjacent characters in ss, they should be adjacent on the keyboard. For example, if the password is abacaba, then the layout cabdefghi... is perfect, since characters a and c are adjacent on the keyboard, and a and b are adjacent on the keyboard. It is guaranteed that there are no two adjacent equal characters in ss, so, for example, the password cannot be password (two characters s are adjacent)."
b'Can you help Polycarp with choosing the perfect layout of the keyboard, if it is possible?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Then TT lines follow, each containing one string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4200) representing the test case. ss consists of lowercase Latin letters only. There are no two adjacent equal characters in ss.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, do the following:'
b'  if it is impossible to assemble a perfect keyboard, print NO (in upper case, it matters in this problem);  otherwise, print YES (in upper case), and then a string consisting of 2626 lowercase Latin letters \xe2\x80\x94 the perfect layout. Each Latin letter should appear in this string exactly once. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. '
