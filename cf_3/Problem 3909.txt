b'A lot of students spend their winter holidays productively. Vlad has advanced very well in doing so! For three days already, fueled by salads and tangerines\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the leftovers from New Year celebration\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he has been calibrating his rating in his favorite MOBA game, playing as a hero named Perun.'
b'Perun has an ultimate ability called "Thunderwrath". At the instant of its activation, each enemy on the map (n of them in total) loses  health points as a single-time effect. It also has a restriction: it can only activated when the moment of time is an integer. The initial bounty for killing an enemy is . Additionally, it increases by  each second. Formally, if at some second t the ability is activated and the i-th enemy is killed as a result (i.e. his health drops to zero or lower), Vlad earns  units of gold.'
b'Every enemy can receive damage, as well as be healed. There are multiple ways of doing so, but Vlad is not interested in details. For each of n enemies he knows: '
b'  \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 maximum number of health points for the i-th enemy;  \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 initial health of the enemy (on the 0-th second);  \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the amount of health the i-th enemy can regenerate per second. '
b'There also m health updates Vlad knows about: '
b'  \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 time when the health was updated;  \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the enemy whose health was updated;  \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 updated health points for enemyj. '
b"Obviously, Vlad wants to maximize his profit. If it's necessary, he could even wait for years to activate his ability at the right second. Help him determine the exact second (note that it must be an integer) from 0 (inclusively) to \xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x9e so that a single activation of the ability would yield Vlad the maximum possible amount of gold, and print this amount."
b'Input'
b'In the first line, two integers are given (separated by spaces)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105).'
b'In the second line, there are three integers: ,  and  (, ).'
b'Each of the following n lines has three integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 , ,  (, ).'
b'The next m lines contain three integers each\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 , ,  (, , ). It is guaranteed that there is no more than one hearth change per second for each enemy: more formally, for each a,\xe2\x80\x89b so that 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m,\xe2\x80\x89a\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89b holds that if , then .'
b'Output'
b'Output the single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum amount of gold Vlad can obtain if he applies "Thunderwrath" exactly once, or -1 if this amount can be infinitely large.'
