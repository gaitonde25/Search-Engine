b"Hiasat registered a new account in NeckoForces and when his friends found out about that, each one of them asked to use his name as Hiasat's handle."
b'Luckily for Hiasat, he can change his handle in some points in time. Also he knows the exact moments friends will visit his profile page. Formally, you are given a sequence of events of two types:'
b"  11\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Hiasat can change his handle.  22 ss\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 friend ss visits Hiasat's profile. "
b"The friend ss will be happy, if each time he visits Hiasat's profile his handle would be ss."
b'Hiasat asks you to help him, find the maximum possible number of happy friends he can get.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4401\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa440)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of events and the number of friends.'
b'Then nn lines follow, each denoting an event of one of two types: '
b"  11\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Hiasat can change his handle.  22 ss\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 friend ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4401\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa440) visits Hiasat's profile. "
b"It's guaranteed, that each friend's name consists only of lowercase Latin letters."
b"It's guaranteed, that the first event is always of the first type and each friend will visit Hiasat's profile at least once."
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of happy friends.'
