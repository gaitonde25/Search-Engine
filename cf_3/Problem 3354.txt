b'In this problem we consider a very simplified model of Barcelona city.'
b'Barcelona can be represented as a plane with streets of kind x=cx=c and y=cy=c for every integer cc (that is, the rectangular grid). However, there is a detail which makes Barcelona different from Manhattan. There is an avenue called Avinguda Diagonal which can be represented as a the set of points (x,y)(x,y) for which ax+by+c=0ax+by+c=0.'
b'One can walk along streets, including the avenue. You are given two integer points AA and BB somewhere in Barcelona. Find the minimal possible distance one needs to travel to get to BB from AA.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers aa, bb and cc (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4109, at least one of aa and bb is not zero) representing the Diagonal Avenue.'
b'The next line contains four integers x1x1, y1y1, x2x2 and y2y2 (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4x1,y1,x2,y2\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4x1,y1,x2,y2\xe2\x89\xa4109) denoting the points A=(x1,y1)A=(x1,y1) and B=(x2,y2)B=(x2,y2).'
b'Output'
b'Find the minimum possible travel distance between AA and BB. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926.'
b"Formally, let your answer be aa, and the jury's answer be bb. Your answer is accepted if and only if |a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,|b|)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926|a\xe2\x88\x92b|max(1,|b|)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926."
