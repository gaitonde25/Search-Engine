b"You decided to rob a town's blacksmith and you take a follower with you. You can carry at most pp units and your follower\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 at most ff units."
b"In the blacksmith shop, you found cntscnts swords and cntwcntw war axes. Each sword weights ss units and each war axe\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 ww units. You don't care what to take, since each of them will melt into one steel ingot."
b'What is the maximum number of weapons (both swords and war axes) you and your follower can carry out from the shop?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b"The first line of each test case contains two integers pp and ff (1\xe2\x89\xa4p,f\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4p,f\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 yours and your follower's capacities."
