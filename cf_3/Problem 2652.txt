b'You are given an array aa consisting of nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an.'
b'In one operation you can choose two elements of the array and replace them with the element equal to their sum (it does not matter where you insert the new element). For example, from the array [2,1,4][2,1,4] you can obtain the following arrays: [3,4][3,4], [1,6][1,6] and [2,5][2,5].'
b'Your task is to find the maximum possible number of elements divisible by 33 that are in the array after performing this operation an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.'
b'You have to answer tt independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'The first line of each query contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100).'
b'The second line of each query contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109). '
b'Output'
b'For each query print one integer in a single line \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible number of elements divisible by 33 that are in the array after performing described operation an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.'
