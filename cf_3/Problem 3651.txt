b'Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for nn flowers and so it looks like a pipe with nn holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.'
b'Arkady can block some of the holes, and then pour AA liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is SS, and the ii-th hole is not blocked, si\xe2\x8b\x85ASsi\xe2\x8b\x85AS liters of water will flow out of it.'
b'What is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least BB liters of water flow out of the first hole?'
b'Input'
