b'\xe2\x80\x94 This is not playing but duty as allies of justice, Nii-chan!'
b'\xe2\x80\x94 Not allies but justice itself, Onii-chan!'
b"With hands joined, go everywhere at a speed faster than our thoughts! This time, the Fire Sisters\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Karen and Tsukihi\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 is heading for somewhere they've never reached\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 water-surrounded islands!"
b'There are three clusters of islands, conveniently coloured red, blue and purple. The clusters consist of a, b and c distinct islands respectively.'
b"Bridges have been built between some (possibly all or none) of the islands. A bridge bidirectionally connects two different islands and has length 1. For any two islands of the same colour, either they shouldn't be reached from each other through bridges, or the shortest distance between them is at least 3, apparently in order to prevent oddities from spreading quickly inside a cluster."
b"The Fire Sisters are ready for the unknown, but they'd also like to test your courage. And you're here to figure out the number of different ways to build all bridges under the constraints, and give the answer modulo 998\xe2\x80\x89244\xe2\x80\x89353. Two ways are considered different if a pair of islands exist, such that there's a bridge between them in one of them, but not in the other."
b'Input'
b'The first and only line of input contains three space-separated integers a, b and c (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b,\xe2\x80\x89c\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x895\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of islands in the red, blue and purple clusters, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Output one line containing an integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of different ways to build bridges, modulo 998\xe2\x80\x89244\xe2\x80\x89353.'
