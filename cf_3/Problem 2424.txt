b"Petya's friends made him a birthday present \xe2\x80\x94 a bracket sequence. Petya was quite disappointed with his gift, because he dreamed of correct bracket sequence, yet he told his friends nothing about his dreams and decided to fix present himself. "
b'To make everything right, Petya is going to move at most one bracket from its original place in the sequence to any other position. Reversing the bracket (e.g. turning "(" into ")" or vice versa) isn\'t allowed. '
b'We remind that bracket sequence ss is called correct if: '
b'  ss is empty;  ss is equal to "(tt)", where tt is correct bracket sequence;  ss is equal to t1t2t1t2, i.e. concatenation of t1t1 and t2t2, where t1t1 and t2t2 are correct bracket sequences. '
b'For example, "(()())", "()" are correct, while ")(" and "())" are not. Help Petya to fix his birthday present and understand whether he can move one bracket so that the sequence becomes correct.'
b'Input'
b'First of line of input contains a single number nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 length of the sequence which Petya received for his birthday.'
b'Second line of the input contains bracket sequence of length nn, containing symbols "(" and ")".'
b'Output'
b'Print "Yes" if Petya can make his sequence correct moving at most one bracket. Otherwise print "No".'
