b"You are given a string ss of 0's and 1's. You are allowed to perform the following operation:"
b" choose a non-empty contiguous substring of ss that contains an equal number of 0's and 1's; flip all characters in the substring, that is, replace all 0's with 1's, and vice versa; reverse the substring. "
b'For example, consider ss = 00111011, and the following operation:'
b" Choose the first six characters as the substring to act upon: 00111011. Note that the number of 0's and 1's are equal, so this is a legal choice. Choosing substrings 0, 110, or the entire string would not be possible. Flip all characters in the substring: 11000111. Reverse the substring: 10001111. "
b' '
b'Find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from ss after zero or more operations.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Each of the following TT lines contains a single non-empty string\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the input string ss for the respective test case.'
b'All strings consist of characters 0 and 1, and their total length does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, on a separate line print the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from ss after zero or more operations.'
