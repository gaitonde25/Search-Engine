You have to restore the structure of the company.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of lower-level employees.'
b'This is followed by nn lines, where ii-th line contains nn integers ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,nai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,n (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa45000) \xe2\x80\x94 salary of the common supervisor of employees with numbers ii and jj. It is guaranteed that ai,j=aj,iai,j=aj,i. Note that ai,iai,i is equal to the salary of the ii-th employee.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line, print a single integer kk \xe2\x80\x94 the number of employees in the company.'
b'In the second line, print kk integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ckc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ck, where cici is the salary of the employee with the number ii.'
b'In the third line, print a single integer rr \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the employee who is the head of the company.'
b'In the following k\xe2\x88\x921k\xe2\x88\x921 lines, print two integers vv and uu (1\xe2\x89\xa4v,u\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4v,u\xe2\x89\xa4k) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the employee and his direct supervisor.'
