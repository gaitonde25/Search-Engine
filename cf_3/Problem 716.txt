b"Two painters, Amin and Benj, are repainting Gregor's living room ceiling! The ceiling can be modeled as an n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m grid."
b'For each ii between 11 and nn, inclusive, painter Amin applies aiai layers of paint to the entire ii-th row. For each jj between 11 and mm, inclusive, painter Benj applies bjbj layers of paint to the entire jj-th column. Therefore, the cell (i,j)(i,j) ends up with ai+bjai+bj layers of paint.'
b'Gregor considers the cell (i,j)(i,j) to be badly painted if ai+bj\xe2\x89\xa4xai+bj\xe2\x89\xa4x. Define a badly painted region to be a maximal connected component of badly painted cells, i.\xc2\xa0e. a connected component of badly painted cells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.'
b'Gregor is appalled by the state of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted regions.'
