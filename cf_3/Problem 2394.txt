b"Alan decided to get in shape for the summer, so he created a precise workout plan to follow. His plan is to go to a different gym every day during the next N days and lift X[i]X[i] grams on day ii. In order to improve his workout performance at the gym, he can buy exactly one pre-workout drink at the gym he is currently in and it will improve his performance by AA grams permanently and immediately. In different gyms these pre-workout drinks can cost different amounts C[i]C[i] because of the taste and the gym's location but its permanent workout gains are the same. Before the first day of starting his workout plan, Alan knows he can lift a maximum of KK grams. Help Alan spend a minimum total amount of money in order to reach his workout plan. If there is no way for him to complete his workout plan successfully output \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921."
b'Input'
b'The first one contains two integer numbers, integers NN (1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105) and KK (1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x93 representing number of days in the workout plan and how many grams he can lift before starting his workout plan respectively. The second line contains NN integer numbers X[i]X[i] (1\xe2\x89\xa4X[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4X[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109) separated by a single space representing how many grams Alan wants to lift on day ii. The third line contains one integer number AA (1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4109) representing permanent performance gains from a single drink. The last line contains NN integer numbers C[i]C[i] (1\xe2\x89\xa4C[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4C[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109) , representing cost of performance booster drink in the gym he visits on day ii.'
b'Output'
