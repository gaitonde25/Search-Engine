b'Alice has a lovely piece of cloth. It has the shape of a square with a side of length aa centimeters. Bob also wants such piece of cloth. He would prefer a square with a side of length bb centimeters (where b<ab<a). Alice wanted to make Bob happy, so she cut the needed square out of the corner of her piece and gave it to Bob. Now she is left with an ugly L shaped cloth (see pictures below).'
b'Alice would like to know whether the area of her cloth expressed in square centimeters is prime. Could you help her to determine it?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a number tt\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b"Each of the next tt lines describes the ii-th test case. It contains two integers aa and b\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4b<a\xe2\x89\xa41011)b\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4b<a\xe2\x89\xa41011)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the side length of Alice's square and the side length of the square that Bob wants."
b'Output'
b'Print tt lines, where the ii-th line is the answer to the ii-th test case. Print "YES" (without quotes) if the area of the remaining piece of cloth is prime, otherwise print "NO".'
b'You can print each letter in an arbitrary case (upper or lower).'
