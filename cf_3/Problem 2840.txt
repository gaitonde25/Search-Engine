b'You are given a regular polygon with nn vertices labeled from 11 to nn in counter-clockwise order. The triangulation of a given polygon is a set of triangles such that each vertex of each triangle is a vertex of the initial polygon, there is no pair of triangles such that their intersection has non-zero area, and the total area of all triangles is equal to the area of the given polygon. The weight of a triangulation is the sum of weigths of triangles it consists of, where the weight of a triagle is denoted as the product of labels of its vertices.'
b'Calculate the minimum weight among all triangulations of the polygon.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains single integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the regular polygon.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum weight among all triangulations of the given polygon.'
