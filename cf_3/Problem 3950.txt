b'You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n, the root is the vertex number 1.'
b"Each vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertex v by cv. Initially cv\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890."
b'You have to color the tree into the given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you can choose a vertex v and a color x, and then color all vectices in the subtree of v (including v itself) in color x. In other words, for every vertex u, such that the path from root to u passes through v, set cu\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89x.'
b'It is guaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from 0.'
b'You can learn what a rooted tree is using the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b'The second line contains n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 integers p2,\xe2\x80\x89p3,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89pn (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89i), where pi means that there is an edge between vertices i and pi.'
b'The third line contains n integers c1,\xe2\x80\x89c2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89cn (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ci\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n), where ci is the color you should color the i-th vertex into.'
b'It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. '
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of steps you have to perform to color the tree into given colors.'
