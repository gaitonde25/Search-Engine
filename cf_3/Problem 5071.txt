b'Paul is at the orchestra. The string section is arranged in an r\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89c rectangular grid and is filled with violinists with the exception of n violists. Paul really likes violas, so he would like to take a picture including at least k of them. Paul can take a picture of any axis-parallel rectangle in the orchestra. Count the number of possible pictures that Paul can take.'
b'Two pictures are considered to be different if the coordinates of corresponding rectangles are different.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains four space-separated integers r, c, n, k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89r,\xe2\x80\x89c,\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns of the string section, the total number of violas, and the minimum number of violas Paul would like in his photograph, respectively.'
b'The next n lines each contain two integers xi and yi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89xi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89r, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89yi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89c): the position of the i-th viola. It is guaranteed that no location appears more than once in the input.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of photographs Paul can take which include at least k violas. '
