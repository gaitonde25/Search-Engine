b'A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers (a,b,c)(a,b,c) such that it is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first cathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to aa, bb and cc, respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is (3,4,5)(3,4,5).'
b'Vasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula that determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some equation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula: c=a2\xe2\x88\x92bc=a2\xe2\x88\x92b.'
b"Obviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers is Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple (3,4,5)(3,4,5): 5=32\xe2\x88\x9245=32\xe2\x88\x924, so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a Pythagorean triple."
b'When Vasya found the right formula (and understood that his formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers (a,b,c)(a,b,c) with 1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4n such that they are Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He asked you to count these triples.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of one line containing one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of triples of integers (a,b,c)(a,b,c) with 1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4n such that they are Pythagorean according both to the real definition and to the formula Vasya came up with.'
