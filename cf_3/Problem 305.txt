b'Binary Spiders are species of spiders that live on Mars. These spiders weave their webs to defend themselves from enemies.'
b'To weave a web, spiders join in pairs. If the first spider in pair has xx legs, and the second spider has yy legs, then they weave a web with durability x\xe2\x8a\x95yx\xe2\x8a\x95y. Here, \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 means bitwise XOR.'
b'Binary Spiders live in large groups. You observe a group of nn spiders, and the ii-th spider has aiai legs.'
b'When the group is threatened, some of the spiders become defenders. Defenders are chosen in the following way. First, there must be at least two defenders. Second, any pair of defenders must be able to weave a web with durability at least kk. Third, there must be as much defenders as possible.'
b'Scientists have researched the behaviour of Binary Spiders for a long time, and now they have a hypothesis that they can always choose the defenders in an optimal way, satisfying the conditions above. You need to verify this hypothesis on your group of spiders. So, you need to understand how many spiders must become defenders. You are not a Binary Spider, so you decided to use a computer to solve this problem.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x921), the amount of spiders in the group and the minimal allowed durability of a web.'
b'The second line contains nn integers aiai (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x921) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of legs the ii-th spider has.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line, print a single integer \xe2\x84\x93\xe2\x84\x93 (2\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x84\x93\xe2\x89\xa4n2\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x84\x93\xe2\x89\xa4n), the maximum possible amount of defenders.'
b'In the second line, print \xe2\x84\x93\xe2\x84\x93 integers bibi, separated by a single space (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 indices of spiders that will become defenders.'
b'If there exists more than one way to choose the defenders, print any of them.'
b"Unfortunately, it may appear that it's impossible to choose the defenders. In this case, print a single integer \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921."
