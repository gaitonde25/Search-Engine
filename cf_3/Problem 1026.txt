b'Your classmate, whom you do not like because he is boring, but whom you respect for his intellect, has two strings: ss of length nn and tt of length mm.'
b'A sequence p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pmp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pm, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4p1<p2<\xe2\x80\xa6<pm\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4p1<p2<\xe2\x80\xa6<pm\xe2\x89\xa4n, is called beautiful, if spi=tispi=ti for all ii from 11 to mm. The width of a sequence is defined as max1\xe2\x89\xa4i<m(pi+1\xe2\x88\x92pi)max1\xe2\x89\xa4i<m(pi+1\xe2\x88\x92pi).'
b'Please help your classmate to identify the beautiful sequence with the maximum width. Your classmate promised you that for the given strings ss and tt there is at least one beautiful sequence.'
