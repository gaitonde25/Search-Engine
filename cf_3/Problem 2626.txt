b"Misha was interested in water delivery from childhood. That's why his mother sent him to the annual Innovative Olympiad in Irrigation (IOI). Pupils from all Berland compete there demonstrating their skills in watering. It is extremely expensive to host such an olympiad, so after the first nn olympiads the organizers introduced the following rule of the host city selection."
b'The host cities of the olympiads are selected in the following way. There are mm cities in Berland wishing to host the olympiad, they are numbered from 11 to mm. The host city of each next olympiad is determined as the city that hosted the olympiad the smallest number of times before. If there are several such cities, the city with the smallest index is selected among them.'
b"Misha's mother is interested where the olympiad will be held in some specific years. The only information she knows is the above selection rule and the host cities of the first nn olympiads. Help her and if you succeed, she will ask Misha to avoid flooding your house."
b'Input'
b"The first line contains three integers nn, mm and qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,q\xe2\x89\xa45000001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m,q\xe2\x89\xa4500000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of olympiads before the rule was introduced, the number of cities in Berland wishing to host the olympiad, and the number of years Misha's mother is interested in, respectively."
b'The next line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4m), where aiai denotes the city which hosted the olympiad in the ii-th year. Note that before the rule was introduced the host city was chosen arbitrarily.'
b"Each of the next qq lines contains an integer kiki (n+1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa41018n+1\xe2\x89\xa4ki\xe2\x89\xa41018)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the year number Misha's mother is interested in host city in."
b'Output'
