b'A binary string is a string that consists of characters 00 and 11. A bi-table is a table that has exactly two rows of equal length, each being a binary string.'
b'Let MEXMEX of a bi-table be the smallest digit among 00, 11, or 22 that does not occur in the bi-table. For example, MEXMEX for [00111010][00111010] is 22, because 00 and 11 occur in the bi-table at least once. MEXMEX for [111111][111111] is 00, because 00 and 22 do not occur in the bi-table, and 0<20<2.'
b'You are given a bi-table with nn columns. You should cut it into any number of bi-tables (each consisting of consecutive columns) so that each column is in exactly one bi-table. It is possible to cut the bi-table into a single bi-table \xe2\x80\x94 the whole bi-table.'
b'What is the maximal sum of MEXMEX of all resulting bi-tables can be?'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of columns in the bi-table.'
b'Each of the next two lines contains a binary string of length nn\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the rows of the bi-table.'
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximal sum of MEXMEX of all bi-tables that it is possible to get by cutting the given bi-table optimally.'
