b'A string ss of length nn, consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, is given.'
b'You must choose some number kk between 00 and nn. Then, you select kk characters of ss and permute them however you want. In this process, the positions of the other n\xe2\x88\x92kn\xe2\x88\x92k characters remain unchanged. You have to perform this operation exactly once.'
b'For example, if s="andrea"s="andrea", you can choose the k=4k=4 characters "a_d_ea""a_d_ea" and permute them into "d_e_aa""d_e_aa" so that after the operation the string becomes "dneraa""dneraa".'
b'Determine the minimum kk so that it is possible to sort ss alphabetically (that is, after the operation its characters appear in alphabetical order).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4401\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa440) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string.'
b'The second line of each test case contains the string ss. It is guaranteed that ss contains only lowercase letters of the English alphabet.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output the minimum kk that allows you to obtain a string sorted alphabetically, through the operation described above.'
