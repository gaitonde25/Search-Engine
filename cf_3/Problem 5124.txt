b'Johnny drives a truck and must deliver a package from his hometown to the district center. His hometown is located at point 0 on a number line, and the district center is located at the point d.'
b"Johnny's truck has a gas tank that holds exactly n liters, and his tank is initially full. As he drives, the truck consumes exactly one liter per unit distance traveled. Moreover, there are m gas stations located at various points along the way to the district center. The i-th station is located at the point xi on the number line and sells an unlimited amount of fuel at a price of pi dollars per liter. Find the minimum cost Johnny must pay for fuel to successfully complete the delivery."

b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum cost to complete the delivery. If there is no way to complete the delivery, print -1.'
