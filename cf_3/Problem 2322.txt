b'Recall that a binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose nodes each store a key and each have at most two distinguished subtrees, left and right. The key in each node must be greater than any key stored in the left subtree, and less than any key stored in the right subtree.'
b'The depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the simple path from the vertex to the root. In particular, the depth of the root is 00.'
b"Let's call a binary search tree perfectly balanced if there doesn't exist a binary search tree with the same number of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths of its vertices."
b"Let's call a binary search tree with integer keys striped if both of the following conditions are satisfied for every vertex vv: "
b'  If vv has a left subtree whose root is uu, then the parity of the key of vv is different from the parity of the key of uu.  If vv has a right subtree whose root is ww, then the parity of the key of vv is the same as the parity of the key of ww. '
b'You are given a single integer nn. Find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with nn vertices that have distinct integer keys between 11 and nn, inclusive. Output this number modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106), denoting the required number of vertices.'
b'Output'
b'Output the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with nn vertices and distinct integer keys between 11 and nn, inclusive, modulo 998244353998244353.'
