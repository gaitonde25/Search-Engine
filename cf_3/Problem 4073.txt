b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'Jury has hidden a permutation p of integers from 0 to n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891. You know only the length n. Remind that in permutation all integers are distinct.'
b"Let b be the inverse permutation for p, i.e. pbi\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89i for all i. The only thing you can do is to ask xor of elements pi and bj, printing two indices i and j (not necessarily distinct). As a result of the query with indices i and j you'll get the value , where  denotes the xor operation. You can find the description of xor operation in notes."
b'Note that some permutations can remain indistinguishable from the hidden one, even if you make all possible n2 queries. You have to compute the number of permutations indistinguishable from the hidden one, and print one of such permutations, making no more than 2n queries.'
b'The hidden permutation does not depend on your queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x895000) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the hidden permutation. You should read this integer first.'
b'Output'
b'When your program is ready to print the answer, print three lines.'
b'In the first line print "!".'
b'In the second line print single integer answers_cnt\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of permutations indistinguishable from the hidden one, including the hidden one. '
b'In the third line print n integers p0,\xe2\x80\x89p1,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89pn\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89pi\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89n, all pi should be distinct)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 one of the permutations indistinguishable from the hidden one.'
b'Your program should terminate after printing the answer.'
