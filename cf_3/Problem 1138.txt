b"Alice and Bob received nn candies from their parents. Each candy weighs either 1 gram or 2 grams. Now they want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies."
b'Check if they can do that.'
b'Note that candies are not allowed to be cut in half.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies that Alice and Bob received.'
b'The next line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the weights of the candies. The weight of each candy is either 11 or 22.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output on a separate line: '
b'  "YES", if all candies can be divided into two sets with the same weight;  "NO" otherwise. '
b'You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).'
