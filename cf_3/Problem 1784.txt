b'Phoenix loves beautiful arrays. An array is beautiful if all its subarrays of length\xc2\xa0kk have the same sum. A subarray of an array is any sequence of consecutive elements.'
b'Phoenix currently has an array aa of length nn. He wants to insert some number of integers, possibly zero, into his array such that it becomes beautiful. The inserted integers must be between 11 and nn inclusive. Integers may be inserted anywhere (even before the first or after the last element), and he is not trying to minimize the number of inserted integers.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa450)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100).'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn space-separated integers (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the array that Phoenix currently has. This array may or may not be already beautiful.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, if it is impossible to create a beautiful array, print -1. Otherwise, print two lines.'
b"The first line should contain the length of the beautiful array mm (n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4104n\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4104). You don't need to minimize mm."
b"The second line should contain mm space-separated integers (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a beautiful array that Phoenix can obtain after inserting some, possibly zero, integers into his array aa. You may print integers that weren't originally in array aa."
b"If there are multiple solutions, print any. It's guaranteed that if we can make array aa beautiful, we can always make it with resulting length no more than 104104."
