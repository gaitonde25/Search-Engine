b'You are given a square board, consisting of nn rows and nn columns. Each tile in it should be colored either white or black.'
b"Let's call some coloring beautiful if each pair of adjacent rows are either the same or different in every position. The same condition should be held for the columns as well."
b"Let's call some coloring suitable if it is beautiful and there is no rectangle of the single color, consisting of at least kk tiles."
b'Your task is to count the number of suitable colorings of the board of the given size.'
b'Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'Input'
b'A single line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n21\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n2) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns of the board and the maximum number of tiles inside the rectangle of the single color, respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of suitable colorings of the board of the given size modulo 998244353998244353.'
