b'You are given a string q. A sequence of k strings s1,\xe2\x80\x89s2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89sk is called beautiful, if the concatenation of these strings is string q (formally, s1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89s2\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89...\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89sk\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89q) and the first characters of these strings are distinct.'
b"Find any beautiful sequence of strings or determine that the beautiful sequence doesn't exist."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a positive integer k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8926) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of strings that should be in a beautiful sequence. '
b'The second line contains string q, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is within range from 1 to 100, inclusive.'
b'Output'
b'If such sequence doesn\'t exist, then print in a single line "NO" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print in the first line "YES" (without the quotes) and in the next k lines print the beautiful sequence of strings s1,\xe2\x80\x89s2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89sk.'
b'If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.'
