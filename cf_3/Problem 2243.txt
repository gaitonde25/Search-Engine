b'Randall is a software engineer at a company with NN employees. Every year, the company re-evaluates its employees. At the end of every year, the company replaces its several worst-performing employees and replaces with the same number of new employees, so that the company keeps having NN employees. Each person has a constant performance and can be represented by an integer (higher integer means better performance), and no two people have the same performance.'
b'The performance of the initial employees are represented by an array of integers A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN]A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN] where AiAi is the performance of the ithith employee. Randall is employee 11, so his performance is A1A1. We will consider the first MM years. At the end of the ithith year, the company replaces its RiRi worst-performing employees and replaces with RiRi new employees. The performance of these new employees are represented by an array of integers Bi=[(Bi)1,(Bi)2,\xe2\x80\xa6,(Bi)Ri]Bi=[(Bi)1,(Bi)2,\xe2\x80\xa6,(Bi)Ri] where (Bi)j(Bi)j is the performance of the jthjth new employee.'
b'He will consider QQ scenarios. On the ithith scenario, he will change the value of (BXi)Yi(BXi)Yi to ZiZi. For each scenario, Randall is wondering whether he will still be in the company after MM years. Note that the changes in each scenario are kept for the subsequent scenarios.'
b'Input'
b'Input begins with a line containing three integers: NN MM QQ (2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000; 1\xe2\x89\xa4M,Q\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4100000) representing the number of employees, the number of years to be considered, and the number of scenarios, respectively. The next line contains NN integers: AiAi (0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) representing the performance of the initial employees. The next MM lines each contains several integers: RiRi (Bi)1(Bi)1, (Bi)2(Bi)2, \xe2\x8b\xaf\xe2\x8b\xaf, (Bi)Ri(Bi)Ri (1\xe2\x89\xa4Ri<N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ri<N; 0\xe2\x89\xa4(Bi)j\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4(Bi)j\xe2\x89\xa4109) representing the number of employees replaced and the performance of the new employees, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of RiRi does not exceed 106106. The next QQ lines each contains three integers: XiXi YiYi ZiZi (1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x89\xa4M; 1\xe2\x89\xa4Yi\xe2\x89\xa4R(Xi)1\xe2\x89\xa4Yi\xe2\x89\xa4R(Xi); 0\xe2\x89\xa4Zi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4Zi\xe2\x89\xa4109) representing a scenario. It is guaranteed that all integers in all AiAi, (Bi)j(Bi)j, and ZiZi (combined together) are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'For each scenario in the same order as input, output in a line an integer 00 if Randall will not be in the company after MM years, or 11 if Randall will still be in the company after MM years.'
