b'Masha is going to participate in a talent show conducted by the university she studies at. She wants to impress the audience with lots of different magic tricks!'
b'For one of her tricks, she uses nn sponge balls, one of which is a special one. First, she arranges the balls in a row in such a way that the special ball is put on position kk (positions are numbered from 11 to nn from left to right). After that, she performs mm swaps: during the ii-th swap, she chooses the ball on position xixi and the ball on position yiyi, and swaps them.'
b'Since Masha is a magician, she fakes some of her actions to trick the audience \xe2\x80\x94 when she starts performing a swap, she may fake it, so it is not performed (but it looks like it is performed for the audience). There are no constraints on which swaps Masha should fake or should actually perform \xe2\x80\x94 for example, she may fake all of the swaps, or even not fake anything at all.'
b'For the trick to work perfectly, the special ball should end up on a specific position \xe2\x80\x94 Masha has not decided yet, which position is perfect. Since faking swaps is difficult, for each position she wants to know the minimum number of swaps she has to fake so that the special ball ends up there. '
b'Unfortunately, Masha is a magician, neither a mathematician nor a programmer. So she needs your help in calculating what she wants!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, mm and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of balls, the number of swaps and the initial position of the special ball, respectively.'
b'Then mm lines follow, the ii-th line contains two integers xixi and yiyi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n; xi\xe2\x89\xa0yixi\xe2\x89\xa0yi) denoting the ii-th swap.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn integers. The ii-th integer should be the minimum number of swaps Masha has to fake so the special ball ends up on position ii (or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921, if Masha cannot put the special ball there).'
