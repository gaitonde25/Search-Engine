b'You have to paint with shades of grey the tiles of an n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n wall. The wall has nn rows of tiles, each with nn tiles.'
b'The tiles on the boundary of the wall (i.e., on the first row, last row, first column and last column) are already painted and you shall not change their color. All the other tiles are not painted. Some of the tiles are broken, you shall not paint those tiles. It is guaranteed that the tiles on the boundary are not broken.'
b'You shall paint all the non-broken tiles that are not already painted. When you paint a tile you can choose from 109109 shades of grey, indexed from 11 to 109109. You can paint multiple tiles with the same shade. Formally, painting the wall is equivalent to assigning a shade (an integer between 11 and 109109) to each non-broken tile that is not already painted.'
b'The contrast between two tiles is the absolute value of the difference between the shades of the two tiles. The total contrast of the wall is the sum of the contrast of all the pairs of adjacent non-broken tiles (two tiles are adjacent if they share a side).'
b'Compute the minimum possible total contrast of the wall.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200) \xe2\x80\x93 the number of rows and columns.'
b'Then nn lines, each containing nn integers, follow. The ii-th of these lines describe the ii-th row of tiles. It contains the nn integers aijaij (\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4aij\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4aij\xe2\x89\xa4109). The value of aijaij described the tile on the ii-th row and jj-th column: '
b'  If aij=0aij=0, then the tile is not painted and shall be painted.  If aij=\xe2\x88\x921aij=\xe2\x88\x921, then the tile is broken and shall not be painted.  If 1\xe2\x89\xa4aij\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4aij\xe2\x89\xa4109, then the tile is already painted with the shade aijaij. '
b' It is guaranteed that the tiles on the boundary are already painted, the tiles not on the boundary are not already painted, and the tiles on the boundary are not broken.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x93 the minimum possible total contrast of the wall.'
