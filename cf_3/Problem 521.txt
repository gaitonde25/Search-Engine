b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'Jury initially had a sequence aa of length nn, such that ai=iai=i.'
b'The jury chose three integers ii, jj, kk, such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j<k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j<k\xe2\x89\xa4n, j\xe2\x88\x92i>1j\xe2\x88\x92i>1. After that, Jury reversed subsegments [i,j\xe2\x88\x921][i,j\xe2\x88\x921] and [j,k][j,k] of the sequence aa.'
b'Reversing a subsegment [l,r][l,r] of the sequence aa means reversing the order of elements al,al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,aral,al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ar in the sequence, i.\xc2\xa0e. alal is swapped with arar, al+1al+1 is swapped with ar\xe2\x88\x921ar\xe2\x88\x921, etc.'
b'You are given the number nn and you should find ii, jj, kk after asking some questions.'
b'In one question you can choose two integers ll and rr (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n) and ask the number of inversions on the subsegment [l,r][l,r] of the sequence aa. You will be given the number of pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that l\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4rl\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4r, and ai>ajai>aj.'
b'Find the chosen numbers ii, jj, kk after at most 4040 questions.'
b'The numbers ii, jj, and kk are fixed before the start of your program and do not depend on your queries.'
b'Input'
b'Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The single line of each test case contains a single integer nn (4\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41094\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109). After reading it you should start an interaction process by asking questions for that test case. After giving an answer you should:'
b'  Terminate your program if that is the last test case.  Proceed to the next test case otherwise. '
