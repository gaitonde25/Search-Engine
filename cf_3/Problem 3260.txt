b'There are nn children numbered from 11 to nn in a kindergarten. Kindergarten teacher gave aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) candies to the ii-th child. Children were seated in a row in order from 11 to nn from left to right and started eating candies. '
b'While the ii-th child was eating candies, he calculated two numbers lili and riri\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of children seating to the left of him that got more candies than he and the number of children seating to the right of him that got more candies than he, respectively.'
b'Formally, lili is the number of indices jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i), such that ai<ajai<aj and riri is the number of indices jj (i<j\xe2\x89\xa4ni<j\xe2\x89\xa4n), such that ai<ajai<aj.'
b'Each child told to the kindergarten teacher the numbers lili and riri that he calculated. Unfortunately, she forgot how many candies she has given to each child. So, she asks you for help: given the arrays ll and rr determine whether she could have given the candies to the children such that all children correctly calculated their values lili and riri, or some of them have definitely made a mistake. If it was possible, find any way how she could have done it.'
b'Input'
b'On the first line there is a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of children in the kindergarten.'
b'On the next line there are nn integers l1,l2,\xe2\x80\xa6,lnl1,l2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ln (0\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4n), separated by spaces.'
b'On the next line, there are nn integer numbers r1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rnr1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rn (0\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n), separated by spaces.'
b'Output'
b'If there is no way to distribute the candies to the children so that all of them calculated their numbers correctly, print \xc2\xabNO\xc2\xbb (without quotes).'
b'Otherwise, print \xc2\xabYES\xc2\xbb (without quotes) on the first line. On the next line, print nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an, separated by spaces\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the numbers of candies the children 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n received, respectively. Note that some of these numbers can be equal, but all numbers should satisfy the condition 1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n. The number of children seating to the left of the ii-th child that got more candies than he should be equal to lili and the number of children seating to the right of the ii-th child that got more candies than he should be equal to riri. If there is more than one solution, find any of them.'
