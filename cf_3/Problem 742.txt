b'Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into nn sub-tracks. You are given an array aa where aiai represents the number of traffic cars in the ii-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as \xe2\x88\x91i=1n\xe2\x88\x91j=i+1n|ai\xe2\x88\x92aj|\xe2\x88\x91i=1n\xe2\x88\x91j=i+1n|ai\xe2\x88\x92aj|, where |x||x| is the absolute value of xx. '
b'You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.'
b'Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer: the minimum inconvenience you can achieve by applying the given operation any (possibly zero) number of times.'
