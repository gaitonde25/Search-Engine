b'Sonya decided that having her own hotel business is the best way of earning money because she can profit and rest wherever she wants.'
b'The country where Sonya lives is an endless line. There is a city in each integer coordinate on this line. She has nn hotels, where the ii-th hotel is located in the city with coordinate xixi. Sonya is a smart girl, so she does not open two or more hotels in the same city.'
b'Sonya understands that her business needs to be expanded by opening new hotels, so she decides to build one more. She wants to make the minimum distance from this hotel to all others to be equal to dd. The girl understands that there are many possible locations to construct such a hotel. Thus she wants to know the number of possible coordinates of the cities where she can build a new hotel. '
b'Because Sonya is lounging in a jacuzzi in one of her hotels, she is asking you to find the number of cities where she can build a new hotel so that the minimum distance from the original nn hotels to the new one is equal to dd.'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains two integers nn and dd (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100, 1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of Sonya's hotels and the needed minimum distance from a new hotel to all others."
b"The second line contains nn different integers in strictly increasing order x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xnx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn (\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of Sonya's hotels."
b'Output'
b'Print the number of cities where Sonya can build a new hotel so that the minimum distance from this hotel to all others is equal to dd.'
