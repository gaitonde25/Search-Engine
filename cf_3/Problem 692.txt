b'Let us call a point of the plane admissible if its coordinates are positive integers less than or equal to 200200.'
b'There is an invisible rectangle such that: '
b'  its vertices are all admissible;  its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes;  its area is strictly positive. '
b' Your task is to guess the perimeter of this rectangle.'
b'In order to guess it, you may ask at most 44 queries. '
b'In each query, you choose a nonempty subset of the admissible points and you are told how many of the chosen points are inside or on the boundary of the invisible rectangle.'
