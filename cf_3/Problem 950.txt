b"Seiji Maki doesn't only like to observe relationships being unfolded, he also likes to observe sequences of numbers, especially permutations. Today, he has his eyes on almost sorted permutations."
b'A permutation a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an of 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n is said to be almost sorted if the condition ai+1\xe2\x89\xa5ai\xe2\x88\x921ai+1\xe2\x89\xa5ai\xe2\x88\x921 holds for all ii between 11 and n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 inclusive.'
b'Maki is considering the list of all almost sorted permutations of 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n, given in lexicographical order, and he wants to find the kk-th permutation in this list. Can you help him to find such permutation?'
b'Permutation pp is lexicographically smaller than a permutation qq if and only if the following holds:'
b' in the first position where pp and qq differ, the permutation pp has a smaller element than the corresponding element in qq.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410181\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41018).'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, print a single line containing the kk-th almost sorted permutation of length nn in lexicographical order, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it doesn't exist."
