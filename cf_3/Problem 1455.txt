b'Alexander is a well-known programmer. Today he decided to finally go out and play football, but with the first hit he left a dent on the new Rolls-Royce of the wealthy businessman Big Vova. Vladimir has recently opened a store on the popular online marketplace "Zmey-Gorynych", and offers Alex a job: if he shows his programming skills by solving a task, he\'ll work as a cybersecurity specialist. Otherwise, he\'ll be delivering some doubtful products for the next two years.'
b"You're given nn positive integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. Using each of them exactly at once, you're to make such sequence b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn that sequence c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn is lexicographically maximal, where ci=GCD(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bi)ci=GCD(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bi) - the greatest common divisor of the first ii elements of bb. "
b'Alexander is really afraid of the conditions of this simple task, so he asks you to solve it.'
b'A sequence aa is lexicographically smaller than a sequence bb if and only if one of the following holds:'
b' aa is a prefix of bb, but a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b; in the first position where aa and bb differ, the sequence aa has a smaller element than the corresponding element in bb.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the sequence aa.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the sequence aa.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 103103.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output the answer in a single line \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the desired sequence bb. If there are multiple answers, print any.'
