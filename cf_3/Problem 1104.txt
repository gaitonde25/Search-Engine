b'Nezzar has a binary string ss of length nn that he wants to share with his best friend, Nanako. Nanako will spend qq days inspecting the binary string. At the same time, Nezzar wants to change the string ss into string ff during these qq days, because it looks better.'
b"It is known that Nanako loves consistency so much. On the ii-th day, Nanako will inspect a segment of string ss from position lili to position riri inclusive. If the segment contains both characters '0' and '1', Nanako becomes unhappy and throws away the string."
b'After this inspection, at the ii-th night, Nezzar can secretly change strictly less than half of the characters in the segment from lili to riri inclusive, otherwise the change will be too obvious.'
b'Now Nezzar wonders, if it is possible to avoid Nanako being unhappy and at the same time have the string become equal to the string ff at the end of these qq days and nights.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers n,qn,q (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851050\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'The second line of each test case contains a binary string ss of length nn.'
b'The third line of each test case contains a binary string ff of length nn.'
b'Then qq lines follow, ii-th of them contains two integers li,rili,ri (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 bounds of the segment, that Nanako will inspect on the ii-th day.'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn for all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105, and the sum of qq for all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print "YES" on the single line if it is possible to avoid Nanako being unhappy and have the string ff at the end of qq days and nights. Otherwise, print "NO".'
b'You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
