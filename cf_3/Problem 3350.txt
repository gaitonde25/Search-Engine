b'Alice and Bob are playing chess on a huge chessboard with dimensions n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n. Alice has a single piece left\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a queen, located at (ax,ay)(ax,ay), while Bob has only the king standing at (bx,by)(bx,by). Alice thinks that as her queen is dominating the chessboard, victory is hers. '
b'But Bob has made a devious plan to seize the victory for himself\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he needs to march his king to (cx,cy)(cx,cy) in order to claim the victory for himself. As Alice is distracted by her sense of superiority, she no longer moves any pieces around, and it is only Bob who makes any turns.'
b'Bob will win if he can move his king from (bx,by)(bx,by) to (cx,cy)(cx,cy) without ever getting in check. Remember that a king can move to any of the 88 adjacent squares. A king is in check if it is on the same rank (i.e. row), file (i.e. column), or diagonal as the enemy queen. '
b'Find whether Bob can win or not.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the dimensions of the chessboard.'
b"The second line contains two integers axax and ayay (1\xe2\x89\xa4ax,ay\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ax,ay\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of Alice's queen."
b"The third line contains two integers bxbx and byby (1\xe2\x89\xa4bx,by\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4bx,by\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of Bob's king."
b'The fourth line contains two integers cxcx and cycy (1\xe2\x89\xa4cx,cy\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4cx,cy\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the location that Bob wants to get to.'
b"It is guaranteed that Bob's king is currently not in check and the target location is not in check either."
b"Furthermore, the king is not located on the same square as the queen (i.e. ax\xe2\x89\xa0bxax\xe2\x89\xa0bx or ay\xe2\x89\xa0byay\xe2\x89\xa0by), and the target does coincide neither with the queen's position (i.e. cx\xe2\x89\xa0axcx\xe2\x89\xa0ax or cy\xe2\x89\xa0aycy\xe2\x89\xa0ay) nor with the king's position (i.e. cx\xe2\x89\xa0bxcx\xe2\x89\xa0bx or cy\xe2\x89\xa0bycy\xe2\x89\xa0by)."
b'Output'
b'Print "YES" (without quotes) if Bob can get from (bx,by)(bx,by) to (cx,cy)(cx,cy) without ever getting in check, otherwise print "NO".'
b'You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
