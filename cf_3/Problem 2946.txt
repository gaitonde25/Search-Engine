b'You are given a line of nn colored squares in a row, numbered from 11 to nn from left to right. The ii-th square initially has the color cici.'
b"Let's say, that two squares ii and jj belong to the same connected component if ci=cjci=cj, and ci=ckci=ck for all kk satisfying i<k<ji<k<j. In other words, all squares on the segment from ii to jj should have the same color."
b'For example, the line [3,3,3][3,3,3] has 11 connected component, while the line [5,2,4,4][5,2,4,4] has 33 connected components.'
b'The game "flood fill" is played on the given line as follows: '
b'  At the start of the game you pick any starting square (this is not counted as a turn).  Then, in each game turn, change the color of the connected component containing the starting square to any other color. '
b'Find the minimum number of turns needed for the entire line to be changed into a single color.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of squares.'
b'The second line contains integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa45000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial colors of the squares.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of the turns needed.'
