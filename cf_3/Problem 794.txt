b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'Note: the XOR-sum of an array a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) is defined as a1\xe2\x8a\x95a2\xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8a\x95ana1\xe2\x8a\x95a2\xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8a\x95an, where \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.'
b'Little Dormi received an array of nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an for Christmas. However, while playing with it over the winter break, he accidentally dropped it into his XOR machine, and the array got lost.'
b'The XOR machine is currently configured with a query size of kk (which you cannot change), and allows you to perform the following type of query: by giving the machine kk distinct indices x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xkx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xk, it will output ax1\xe2\x8a\x95ax2\xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8a\x95axkax1\xe2\x8a\x95ax2\xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8a\x95axk.'
b"As Little Dormi's older brother, you would like to help him recover the XOR-sum of his array a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an by querying the XOR machine."
b"Little Dormi isn't very patient, so to be as fast as possible, you must query the XOR machine the minimum number of times to find the XOR-sum of his array. Formally, let dd be the minimum number of queries needed to find the XOR-sum of any array of length nn with a query size of kk. Your program will be accepted if you find the correct XOR-sum in at most dd queries."
b"Lastly, you also noticed that with certain configurations of the machine kk and values of nn, it may not be possible to recover the XOR-sum of Little Dormi's lost array. If that is the case, you should report it as well."
b'The array a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an is fixed before you start querying the XOR machine and does not change with the queries.'
b'Input'
b'The only line of input contains the integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n), the length of the lost array and the configured query size of the XOR machine.'
b'Elements of the original array satisfy 1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109.'
b'It can be proven that that if it is possible to recover the XOR sum under the given constraints, it can be done in at most 500500 queries. That is, d\xe2\x89\xa4500d\xe2\x89\xa4500.'
b'After taking nn and kk, begin interaction.'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to recover the XOR-sum of the array, output \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 immediately after taking nn and kk. Do not begin interaction.'
b'Otherwise, when your program finds the XOR-sum of the lost array a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an, report the answer in the following format: "! x", where xx is the XOR sum of the array a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an, and terminate your program normally immediately after flushing the output stream. '
b'Note that answering does not count as a query.'
