b'Sonya decided to organize an exhibition of flowers. Since the girl likes only roses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be in this exhibition.'
b'There are nn flowers in a row in the exhibition. Sonya can put either a rose or a lily in the ii-th position. Thus each of nn positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily.'
b'She knows that exactly mm people will visit this exhibition. The ii-th visitor will visit all flowers from lili to riri inclusive. The girl knows that each segment has its own beauty that is equal to the product of the number of roses and the number of lilies.'
b'Sonya wants her exhibition to be liked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4103)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of flowers and visitors respectively.'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two integers lili and riri (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4n), meaning that ii-th visitor will visit all flowers from lili to riri inclusive.'
b'Output'
b'Print the string of nn characters. The ii-th symbol should be \xc2\xab0\xc2\xbb if you want to put a rose in the ii-th position, otherwise \xc2\xab1\xc2\xbb if you want to put a lily.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any.'
