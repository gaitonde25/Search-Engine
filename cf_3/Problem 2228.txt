b'This is an interactive problem.'
b"Khanh has nn points on the Cartesian plane, denoted by a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. All points' coordinates are integers between \xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x88\x92109 and 109109, inclusive. No three points are collinear. He says that these points are vertices of a convex polygon; in other words, there exists a permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn of integers from 11 to nn such that the polygon ap1ap2\xe2\x80\xa6apnap1ap2\xe2\x80\xa6apn is convex and vertices are listed in counter-clockwise order."
b'Khanh gives you the number nn, but hides the coordinates of his points. Your task is to guess the above permutation by asking multiple queries. In each query, you give Khanh 44 integers tt, ii, jj, kk; where either t=1t=1 or t=2t=2; and ii, jj, kk are three distinct indices from 11 to nn, inclusive. In response, Khanh tells you:'
b'  if t=1t=1, the area of the triangle aiajakaiajak multiplied by 22.  if t=2t=2, the sign of the cross product of two vectors aiaj\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x88\x92aiaj\xe2\x86\x92 and aiak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x88\x92aiak\xe2\x86\x92. '
b'Recall that the cross product of vector a\xe2\x86\x92=(xa,ya)a\xe2\x86\x92=(xa,ya) and vector b\xe2\x86\x92=(xb,yb)b\xe2\x86\x92=(xb,yb) is the integer xa\xe2\x8b\x85yb\xe2\x88\x92xb\xe2\x8b\x85yaxa\xe2\x8b\x85yb\xe2\x88\x92xb\xe2\x8b\x85ya. The sign of a number is 11 it it is positive, and \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 otherwise. It can be proven that the cross product obtained in the above queries can not be 00.'
b'You can ask at most 3\xe2\x8b\x85n3\xe2\x8b\x85n queries.'
b'Please note that Khanh fixes the coordinates of his points and does not change it while answering your queries. You do not need to guess the coordinates. In your permutation ap1ap2\xe2\x80\xa6apnap1ap2\xe2\x80\xa6apn, p1p1 should be equal to 11 and the indices of vertices should be listed in counter-clockwise order.'
