b"Unlike Knights of a Round Table, Knights of a Polygonal Table deprived of nobility and happy to kill each other. But each knight has some power and a knight can kill another knight if and only if his power is greater than the power of victim. However, even such a knight will torment his conscience, so he can kill no more than kk other knights. Also, each knight has some number of coins. After a kill, a knight can pick up all victim's coins."
b'Now each knight ponders: how many coins he can have if only he kills other knights?'
b'You should answer this question for each knight.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4min(n\xe2\x88\x921,10))(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4min(n\xe2\x88\x921,10)) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of knights and the number kk from the statement.'
b'The second line contains nn integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 powers of the knights. All pipi are distinct.'
b'The third line contains nn integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4109)(0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of coins each knight has.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn integers \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of coins each knight can have it only he kills other knights.'
