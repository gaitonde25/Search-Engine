b'Maxim wants to buy some games at the local game shop. There are nn games in the shop, the ii-th game costs cici.'
b'Maxim has a wallet which can be represented as an array of integers. His wallet contains mm bills, the jj-th bill has value ajaj.'
b'Games in the shop are ordered from left to right, Maxim tries to buy every game in that order.'
b'When Maxim stands at the position ii in the shop, he takes the first bill from his wallet (if his wallet is empty then he proceeds to the next position immediately) and tries to buy the ii-th game using this bill. After Maxim tried to buy the nn-th game, he leaves the shop.'
b'Maxim buys the ii-th game if and only if the value of the first bill (which he takes) from his wallet is greater or equal to the cost of the ii-th game. If he successfully buys the ii-th game, the first bill from his wallet disappears and the next bill becomes first. Otherwise Maxim leaves the first bill in his wallet (this bill still remains the first one) and proceeds to the next game.'
b"For example, for array c=[2,4,5,2,4]c=[2,4,5,2,4] and array a=[5,3,4,6]a=[5,3,4,6] the following process takes place: Maxim buys the first game using the first bill (its value is 55), the bill disappears, after that the second bill (with value 33) becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet, then Maxim doesn't buy the second game because c2>a2c2>a2, the same with the third game, then he buys the fourth game using the bill of value a2a2 (the third bill becomes the first one in Maxim's wallet) and buys the fifth game using the bill of value a3a3."
b'Your task is to get the number of games Maxim will buy.'
b'Input'
b"The first line of the input contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of games and the number of bills in Maxim's wallet."
b'The second line of the input contains nn integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41000), where cici is the cost of the ii-th game.'
b"The third line of the input contains mm integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ama1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,am (1\xe2\x89\xa4aj\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4aj\xe2\x89\xa41000), where ajaj is the value of the jj-th bill from the Maxim's wallet."
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of games Maxim will buy.'
