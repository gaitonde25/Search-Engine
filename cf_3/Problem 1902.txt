b'You are given a integer nn (n>0n>0). Find any integer ss which satisfies these conditions, or report that there are no such numbers:'
b'In the decimal representation of ss: '
b"  s>0s>0,  ss consists of nn digits,  no digit in ss equals 00,  ss is not divisible by any of it's digits. "
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa44001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4400), the number of test cases. The next tt lines each describe a test case.'
b'Each test case contains one positive integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print an integer ss which satisfies the conditions described above, or "-1" (without quotes), if no such number exists. If there are multiple possible solutions for ss, print any solution.'
