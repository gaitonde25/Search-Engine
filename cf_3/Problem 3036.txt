b'Makoto has a big blackboard with a positive integer nn written on it. He will perform the following action exactly kk times:'
b'Suppose the number currently written on the blackboard is vv. He will randomly pick one of the divisors of vv (possibly 11 and vv) and replace vv with this divisor. As Makoto uses his famous random number generator (RNG) and as he always uses 5858 as his generator seed, each divisor is guaranteed to be chosen with equal probability.'
b'He now wonders what is the expected value of the number written on the blackboard after kk steps.'
b'It can be shown that this value can be represented as PQPQ where PP and QQ are coprime integers and Q\xe2\x89\xa1\xcc\xb80(mod109+7)Q\xe2\x89\xa20(mod109+7). Print the value of P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+7109+7.'
b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410151\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41015, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4104).'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the expected value of the number on the blackboard after kk steps as P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921(mod109+7)P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921(mod109+7) for PP, QQ defined above.'
