b'Limak is a little polar bear. He likes nice strings \xe2\x80\x94 strings of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters only.'
b'The distance between two letters is defined as the difference between their positions in the alphabet. For example, , and .'
b'Also, the distance between two nice strings is defined as the sum of distances of corresponding letters. For example, , and .'
b'Limak gives you a nice string s and an integer k. He challenges you to find any nice string s\' that . Find any s\' satisfying the given conditions, or print "-1" if it\'s impossible to do so.'
b'As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.'

b'Output'
b'If there is no string satisfying the given conditions then print "-1" (without the quotes).'
b"Otherwise, print any nice string s' that ."
