b'The company "Divan\'s Sofas" is planning to build n+1n+1 different buildings on a coordinate line so that: '
b'  the coordinate of each building is an integer number;  no two buildings stand at the same point. '
b'Let xixi be the coordinate of the ii-th building. To get from the building ii to the building jj, Divan spends |xi\xe2\x88\x92xj||xi\xe2\x88\x92xj| minutes, where |y||y| is the absolute value of yy.'
b'All buildings that Divan is going to build can be numbered from 00 to nn. The businessman will live in the building 00, the new headquarters of "Divan\'s Sofas". In the first ten years after construction Divan will visit the ii-th building aiai times, each time spending 2\xe2\x8b\x85|x0\xe2\x88\x92xi|2\xe2\x8b\x85|x0\xe2\x88\x92xi| minutes for walking.'
b'Divan asks you to choose the coordinates for all n+1n+1 buildings so that over the next ten years the businessman will spend as little time for walking as possible.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer number tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4103) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of buildings that "Divan\'s Sofas" is going to build, apart from the headquarters.'
b'The second line contains the sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4106), where aiai is the number of visits to the ii-th building.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, on the first line print the number TT \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum time Divan will spend walking. '
b'On the second line print the sequence x0,x1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xnx0,x1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn of n+1n+1 integers, where xixi (\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4106\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4106) is the selected coordinate of the ii-th building. It can be shown that an optimal answer exists with coordinates not exceeding 106106.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
