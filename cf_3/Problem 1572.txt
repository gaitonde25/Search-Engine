b'There are nn piles of stones, where the ii-th pile has aiai stones. Two people play a game, where they take alternating turns removing stones.'
b'In a move, a player may remove a positive number of stones from the first non-empty pile (the pile with the minimal index, that has at least one stone). The first player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses the game. If both players play optimally, determine the winner of the game.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next 2t2t lines contain descriptions of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of piles.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 aiai is equal to the number of stones in the ii-th pile.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, if the player who makes the first move will win, output "First". Otherwise, output "Second".'
