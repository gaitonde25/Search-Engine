b'Nastya received one more array on her birthday, this array can be used to play a traditional Byteland game on it. However, to play the game the players should first select such a subsegment of the array that , where p is the product of all integers on the given array, s is their sum, and k is a given constant for all subsegments. '
b'Nastya wonders how many subsegments of the array fit the described conditions. A subsegment of an array is several consecutive integers of the array.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n and k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105), where n is the length of the array and k is the constant described above.'
b'The second line contains n integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89108)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array.'
b'Output'
b'In the only line print the number of subsegments such that the ratio between the product and the sum on them is equal to k.'
