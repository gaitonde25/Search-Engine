b'Two players play a game.'
b'Initially there are nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an written on the board. Each turn a player selects one number and erases it from the board. This continues until there is only one number left on the board, i.\xc2\xa0e. n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 turns are made. The first player makes the first move, then players alternate turns.'
b'The first player wants to minimize the last number that would be left on the board, while the second player wants to maximize it.'
b'You want to know what number will be left on the board after n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 turns if both players make optimal moves.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of numbers on the board.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4106).'
b'Output'
b'Print one number that will be left on the board.'
