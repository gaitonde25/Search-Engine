b'Hooray! Polycarp turned nn years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!'
b'Polycarp celebrated all of his nn birthdays: from the 11-th to the nn-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?'
b'According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 11, 7777, 777777, 4444 and 999999999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 1212, 1111011110, 69696969 and 987654321987654321.'
b'Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).'
b'Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 11 to nn (inclusive) that are beautiful.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 how many years Polycarp has turned.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt integers \xe2\x80\x94 the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 11 and nn, inclusive.'
