b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'Ayush devised yet another scheme to set the password of his lock. The lock has nn slots where each slot can hold any non-negative integer. The password PP is a sequence of nn integers, ii-th element of which goes into the ii-th slot of the lock.'
b'To set the password, Ayush comes up with an array AA of nn integers each in the range [0,263\xe2\x88\x921][0,263\xe2\x88\x921]. He then sets the ii-th element of PP as the bitwise OR of all integers in the array except AiAi.'
b'You need to guess the password. To make a query, you can choose a non-empty subset of indices of the array and ask the bitwise OR all elements of the array with index in this subset. You can ask no more than 13 queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)(2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of slots in the lock.'
