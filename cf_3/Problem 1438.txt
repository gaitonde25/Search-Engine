b'There are nn points on a plane. The ii-th point has coordinates (xi,yi)(xi,yi). You have two horizontal platforms, both of length kk. Each platform can be placed anywhere on a plane but it should be placed horizontally (on the same yy-coordinate) and have integer borders. If the left border of the platform is (x,y)(x,y) then the right border is (x+k,y)(x+k,y) and all points between borders (including borders) belong to the platform.'
b'Note that platforms can share common points (overlap) and it is not necessary to place both platforms on the same yy-coordinate.'
b'When you place both platforms on a plane, all points start falling down decreasing their yy-coordinate. If a point collides with some platform at some moment, the point stops and is saved. Points which never collide with any platform are lost.'
b'Your task is to find the maximum number of points you can save if you place both platforms optimally.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'For better understanding, please read the Note section below to see a picture for the first test case.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of the test case contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of points and the length of each platform, respectively. The second line of the test case contains nn integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xnx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109), where xixi is xx-coordinate of the ii-th point. The third line of the input contains nn integers y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yny1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yn (1\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa4109), where yiyi is yy-coordinate of the ii-th point. All points are distinct (there is no pair 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4n such that xi=xjxi=xj and yi=yjyi=yj).'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105 (\xe2\x88\x91n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\xe2\x88\x91n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer: the maximum number of points you can save if you place both platforms optimally.'
