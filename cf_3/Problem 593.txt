b'You are given a strictly convex polygon with nn vertices.'
b'You will make kk cuts that meet the following conditions: '
b'  each cut is a segment that connects two different nonadjacent vertices;  two cuts can intersect only at vertices of the polygon. '
b'Your task is to maximize the area of the smallest region that will be formed by the polygon and those kk cuts.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn, kk (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42003\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200, 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9230\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x923).'
b'The following nn lines describe vertices of the polygon in anticlockwise direction. The ii-th line contains two integers xixi, yiyi (|xi|,|yi|\xe2\x89\xa4108|xi|,|yi|\xe2\x89\xa4108) \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the ii-th vertex.'
b'It is guaranteed that the polygon is convex and that no two adjacent sides are parallel.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer: the maximum possible area of the smallest region after making kk cuts multiplied by 22.'
