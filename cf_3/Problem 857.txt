b'You have an initially empty cauldron, and you want to brew a potion in it. The potion consists of two ingredients: magic essence and water. The potion you want to brew should contain exactly k\xc2\xa0%k\xc2\xa0% magic essence and (100\xe2\x88\x92k)\xc2\xa0%(100\xe2\x88\x92k)\xc2\xa0% water.'
b"In one step, you can pour either one liter of magic essence or one liter of water into the cauldron. What is the minimum number of steps to brew a potion? You don't care about the total volume of the potion, only about the ratio between magic essence and water in it."
b'A small reminder: if you pour ee liters of essence and ww liters of water (e+w>0e+w>0) into the cauldron, then it contains ee+w\xe2\x8b\x85100\xc2\xa0%ee+w\xe2\x8b\x85100\xc2\xa0% (without rounding) magic essence and we+w\xe2\x8b\x85100\xc2\xa0%we+w\xe2\x8b\x85100\xc2\xa0% water.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the single tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the percentage of essence in a good potion.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, print the minimum number of steps to brew a good potion. It can be proved that it's always possible to achieve it in a finite number of steps."
