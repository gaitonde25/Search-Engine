b'Reading the book "Equations of Mathematical Magic" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta found an interesting equation: a\xe2\x88\x92(a\xe2\x8a\x95x)\xe2\x88\x92x=0a\xe2\x88\x92(a\xe2\x8a\x95x)\xe2\x88\x92x=0 for some given aa, where \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two integers (this operation is denoted as ^ or xor in many modern programming languages). Oira-Oira quickly found some xx, which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira\'s result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions of this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-Oira, so he asks you to help.'
b'Input'
b"Each test contains several possible values of aa and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each of them. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of these values."
b'The following tt lines contain the values of parameter aa, each value is an integer from 00 to 230\xe2\x88\x921230\xe2\x88\x921 inclusive.'
b'Output'
b'For each value of aa print exactly one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given value of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of aa appear in the input.'
b'One can show that the number of solutions is always finite.'
