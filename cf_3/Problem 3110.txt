b'Vasya owns three strings ss , aa and bb, each of them consists only of first kk Latin letters.'
b'Let a template be such a string of length kk that each of the first kk Latin letters appears in it exactly once (thus there are k!k! distinct templates). Application of template pp to the string ss is the replacement of each character in string ss with pipi, ii is the index of this letter in the alphabet. For example, applying template "bdca" to a string "aabccd" yields string "bbdcca".'
b'Vasya wants to know if there exists such a template which yields a string lexicographically greater than or equal to string aa and lexicographically less than or equal to string bb after applying it to ss.'
b'If there exist multiple suitable templates, print any of them.'
b'String aa is lexicographically less than string bb if there is some ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n) that ai<biai<bi and for any jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i) aj=bjaj=bj.'
b'You are required to answer tt testcases independently.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of testcases.'
b'In hacks you can only use t=1t=1.'
b'Each of the next tt lines contains the description of the testcase in the following form:'
b'The first line of the testcase contains a single integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4261\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa426) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the template.'
b'The second line of the testcase contains the string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4106).'
b'The third line of the testcase contains the string aa.'
b'The fourth line of the testcase contains the string bb.'
b'Strings ss, aa and bb have the same length (|s|=|a|=|b||s|=|a|=|b|) and consist only of the first kk Latin letters, all letters are lowercase.'
b'It is guaranteed that string aa is lexicographically less than or equal to string bb.'
b"It is also guaranteed that the total length of strings over all testcase won't exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851063\xe2\x8b\x85106."
b'Output'
b'Print the answers to all testcases in the following form:'
b'If there exists no suitable template then print "NO" in the first line.'
b'Otherwise print "YES" in the first line and the template itself in the second line (kk lowercase letters, each of the first kk Latin letters should appear exactly once).'
b'If there exist multiple suitable templates, print any of them.'
