b'Edogawa Conan got tired of solving cases, and invited his friend, Professor Agasa, over. They decided to play a game of cards. Conan has n cards, and the i-th card has a number ai written on it.'
b'They take turns playing, starting with Conan. In each turn, the player chooses a card and removes it. Also, he removes all cards having a number strictly lesser than the number on the chosen card. Formally, if the player chooses the i-th card, he removes that card and removes the j-th card for all j such that aj\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89ai.'
b'A player loses if he cannot make a move on his turn, that is, he loses if there are no cards left. Predict the outcome of the game, assuming both players play optimally.'
