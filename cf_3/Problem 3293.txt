b'Janusz is a businessman. He owns a company "Januszex", which produces games for teenagers. Last hit of Januszex was a cool one-person game "Make it one". The player is given a sequence of nn integers aiai.'
b'It is allowed to select any subset of them, and the score is equal to the greatest common divisor of selected elements. The goal is to take as little elements as it is possible, getting the score 11. Now Janusz wonders, for given sequence, how much elements should the player choose?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an only integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4300000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of integers in the sequence.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa43000001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4300000).'
b'Output'
b'If there is no subset of the given sequence with gcd equal to 11, output -1.'
b'Otherwise, output exactly one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of the smallest subset with gcd equal to 11.'
