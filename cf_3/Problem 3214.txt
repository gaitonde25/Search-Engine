b'You are given a positive integer nn greater or equal to 22. For every pair of integers aa and bb (2\xe2\x89\xa4|a|,|b|\xe2\x89\xa4n2\xe2\x89\xa4|a|,|b|\xe2\x89\xa4n), you can transform aa into bb if and only if there exists an integer xx such that 1<|x|1<|x| and (a\xe2\x8b\x85x=ba\xe2\x8b\x85x=b or b\xe2\x8b\x85x=ab\xe2\x8b\x85x=a), where |x||x| denotes the absolute value of xx.'
b'After such a transformation, your score increases by |x||x| points and you are not allowed to transform aa into bb nor bb into aa anymore.'
b'Initially, you have a score of 00. You can start at any integer and transform it as many times as you like. What is the maximum score you can achieve?'
b'Input'
b'A single line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the given integer described above.'
b'Output'
b'Print an only integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum score that can be achieved with the transformations. If it is not possible to perform even a single transformation for all possible starting integers, print 00.'
