b'You are given a string ss consisting of nn characters. These characters are among the first kk lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. You have to perform nn operations with the string.'
b'During the ii-th operation, you take the character that initially occupied the ii-th position, and perform one of the following actions with it:'
b'  swap it with the previous character in the string (if it exists). This operation is represented as L;  swap it with the next character in the string (if it exists). This operation is represented as R;  cyclically change it to the previous character in the alphabet (b becomes a, c becomes b, and so on; a becomes the kk-th letter of the Latin alphabet). This operation is represented as D;  cyclically change it to the next character in the alphabet (a becomes b, b becomes c, and so on; the kk-th letter of the Latin alphabet becomes a). This operation is represented as U;  do nothing. This operation is represented as 0. '
b'For example, suppose the initial string is test, k=20k=20, and the sequence of operations is URLD. Then the string is transformed as follows:'
b'  the first operation is U, so we change the underlined letter in test to the next one in the first 2020 Latin letters, which is a. The string is now aest;  the second operation is R, so we swap the underlined letter with the next one in the string aest. The string is now aset;  the third operation is L, so we swap the underlined letter with the previous one in the string aset (note that this is now the 22-nd character of the string, but it was initially the 33-rd one, so the 33-rd operation is performed to it). The resulting string is saet;  the fourth operation is D, so we change the underlined letter in saet to the previous one in the first 2020 Latin letters, which is s. The string is now saes. '
b'The result of performing the sequence of operations is saes.'
b'Given the string ss and the value of kk, find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after applying a sequence of operations to ss.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500; 2\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4262\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa426). '
b'The second line contains a string ss consisting of nn characters. Each character is one of the kk first letters of the Latin alphabet (in lower case).'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one line containing the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from ss using one sequence of operations.'
