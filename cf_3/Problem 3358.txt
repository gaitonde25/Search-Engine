b'You are given two positive integers aa and bb. There are two possible operations: '
b'  multiply one of the numbers by some prime pp;  divide one of the numbers on its prime factor pp. '
b'What is the minimum number of operations required to obtain two integers having the same number of divisors? You are given several such pairs, you need to find the answer for each of them.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pairs of integers for which you are to find the answer.'
b'Each of the next tt lines contain two integers aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4106).'
b'Output'
b'Output tt lines \xe2\x80\x94 the ii-th of them should contain the answer for the pair aiai, bibi.'
