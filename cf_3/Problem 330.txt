b'Dasha has 1010010100 coins. Recently, she found a binary string ss of length nn and some operations that allows to change this string (she can do each operation any number of times):'
b'  Replace substring 00 of ss by 0 and receive aa coins.  Replace substring 11 of ss by 1 and receive bb coins.  Remove 0 from any position in ss and pay cc coins. '
b'It turned out that while doing this operations Dasha should follow the rule:'
b'  It is forbidden to do two operations with the same parity in a row. Operations are numbered by integers 11-33 in the order they are given above. '
b'Please, calculate what is the maximum profit Dasha can get by doing these operations and following this rule.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains four integers nn, aa, bb, cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'The second line of each test case contains a binary string ss of length nn.'
b"It is guaranteed that the total sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case print the answer.'
