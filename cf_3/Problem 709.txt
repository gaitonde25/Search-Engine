b'You are given a string ss of length nn. Each character is either one of the first kk lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.'
b'You are asked to replace every question mark with one of the first kk lowercase Latin letters in such a way that the following value is maximized.'
b"Let fifi be the maximum length substring of string ss, which consists entirely of the ii-th Latin letter. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. If the ii-th letter doesn't appear in a string, then fifi is equal to 00."
b'The value of a string ss is the minimum value among fifi for all ii from 11 to kk.'
b'What is the maximum value the string can have?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105; 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4171\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa417)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string and the number of first Latin letters used.'
b'The second line contains a string ss, consisting of nn characters. Each character is either one of the first kk lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum value of the string after every question mark is replaced with one of the first kk lowercase Latin letters.'
