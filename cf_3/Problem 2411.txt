b'Recently Vasya decided to improve his pistol shooting skills. Today his coach offered him the following exercise. He placed nn cans in a row on a table. Cans are numbered from left to right from 11 to nn. Vasya has to knock down each can exactly once to finish the exercise. He is allowed to choose the order in which he will knock the cans down.'
b'Vasya knows that the durability of the ii-th can is aiai. It means that if Vasya has already knocked xx cans down and is now about to start shooting the ii-th one, he will need (ai\xe2\x8b\x85x+1)(ai\xe2\x8b\x85x+1) shots to knock it down. You can assume that if Vasya starts shooting the ii-th can, he will be shooting it until he knocks it down.'
b'Your task is to choose such an order of shooting so that the number of shots required to knock each of the nn given cans down exactly once is minimum possible.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)(2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cans.'
b'The second line of the input contains the sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000), where aiai is the durability of the ii-th can.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print the minimum number of shots required to knock each of the nn given cans down exactly once.'
b'In the second line print the sequence consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn \xe2\x80\x94 the order of indices of cans that minimizes the number of shots required. If there are several answers, you can print any of them.'
