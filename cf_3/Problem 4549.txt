b'Little Timofey has a big tree\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 an undirected connected graph with n vertices and no simple cycles. He likes to walk along it. His tree is flat so when he walks along it he sees it entirely. Quite naturally, when he stands on a vertex, he sees the tree as a rooted tree with the root in this vertex.'
b'Timofey assumes that the more non-isomorphic subtrees are there in the tree, the more beautiful the tree is. A subtree of a vertex is a subgraph containing this vertex and all its descendants. You should tell Timofey the vertex in which he should stand to see the most beautiful rooted tree.'
b'Subtrees of vertices u and v are isomorphic if the number of children of u equals the number of children of v, and their children can be arranged in such a way that the subtree of the first son of u is isomorphic to the subtree of the first son of v, the subtree of the second son of u is isomorphic to the subtree of the second son of v, and so on. In particular, subtrees consisting of single vertex are isomorphic to each other.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of vertices in the tree.'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines contains two integers ui and vi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ui,\xe2\x80\x89vi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105, ui\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89vi), denoting the vertices the i-th edge connects.'
b'It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the index of the vertex in which Timofey should stand. If there are many answers, you can print any of them.'
