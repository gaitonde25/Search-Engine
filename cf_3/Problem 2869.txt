b'Polycarp is going to participate in the contest. It starts at h1:m1h1:m1 and ends at h2:m2h2:m2. It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even number of minutes (i.e. m1%2=m2%2m1%2=m2%2, where x%yx%y is xx modulo yy). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held during a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at least two minutes.'
b'Polycarp wants to know the time of the midpoint of the contest. For example, if the contest lasts from 10:0010:00 to 11:0011:00 then the answer is 10:3010:30, if the contest lasts from 11:1011:10 to 11:1211:12 then the answer is 11:1111:11.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers h1h1 and m1m1 in the format hh:mm.'
b'The second line of the input contains two integers h2h2 and m2m2 in the same format (hh:mm).'
