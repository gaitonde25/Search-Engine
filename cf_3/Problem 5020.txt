b'n ants are on a circle of length m. An ant travels one unit of distance per one unit of time. Initially, the ant number i is located at the position si and is facing in the direction di (which is either L or R). Positions are numbered in counterclockwise order starting from some point. Positions of the all ants are distinct.'
b'All the ants move simultaneously, and whenever two ants touch, they will both switch their directions. Note that it is possible for an ant to move in some direction for a half of a unit of time and in opposite direction for another half of a unit of time.'
b'Print the positions of the ants after t time units.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers n, m and t (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893\xc2\xb7105,\xe2\x80\x892\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109,\xe2\x80\x890\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89t\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891018) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ants, the length of the circle and the number of time units.'
b'Each of the next n lines contains integer si and symbol di (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89si\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m and di is either L or R) \xe2\x80\x94 the position and the direction of the i-th ant at the start. The directions L and R corresponds to the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, respectively.'
b'It is guaranteed that all positions si are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'Print n integers xj \xe2\x80\x94 the position of the j-th ant after t units of time. The ants are numbered from 1 to n in order of their appearing in input.'
