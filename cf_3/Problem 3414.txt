b'Abendsen assigned a mission to Juliana. In this mission, Juliana has a rooted tree with nn vertices. Vertex number 11 is the root of this tree. Each vertex can be either black or white. At first, all vertices are white. Juliana is asked to process qq queries. Each query is one of three types:'
b'  If vertex vv is white, mark it as black; otherwise, perform this operation on all direct sons of vv instead.  Mark all vertices in the subtree of vv (including vv) as white.  Find the color of the ii-th vertex. '
b'  An example of operation "1 1" (corresponds to the first example test). The vertices 11 and 22 are already black, so the operation goes to their sons instead. '
b'Can you help Juliana to process all these queries?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and qq (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices and the number of queries.'
b'The second line contains n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 integers p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pnp2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pn (1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i), where pipi means that there is an edge between vertices ii and pipi. '
b'Each of the next qq lines contains two integers titi and vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa431\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa43, 1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the type of the ii-th query and the vertex of the ii-th query.'
b'It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.'
b'Output'
b'For each query of type 33, print "black" if the vertex is black; otherwise, print "white".'
