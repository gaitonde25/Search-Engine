b'You are given two qubits in state |00\xe2\x9f\xa9|00\xe2\x9f\xa9. Your task is to prepare the following state on them:'
b'13\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x88\x9a(|01\xe2\x9f\xa9+|10\xe2\x9f\xa9+|11\xe2\x9f\xa9)13(|01\xe2\x9f\xa9+|10\xe2\x9f\xa9+|11\xe2\x9f\xa9)'
b'This task is very similar to problem A1 of the Winter 2019 contest, but this time you are not allowed to use any gates except the Pauli gates (X, Y and Z), the Hadamard gate and the controlled versions of those. However, you are allowed to use measurements.'
b'You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.'
b'Your code should have the following signature:'
b'namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Unit {        // your code here    }}'
