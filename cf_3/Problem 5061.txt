b'A tree is a connected undirected graph consisting of n vertices and n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x891 edges. Vertices are numbered 1 through n.'
b"Limak is a little polar bear and Radewoosh is his evil enemy. Limak once had a tree but Radewoosh stolen it. Bear is very sad now because he doesn't remember much about the tree\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 he can tell you only three values n, d and h:"
b'  The tree had exactly n vertices.  The tree had diameter d. In other words, d was the biggest distance between two vertices.  Limak also remembers that he once rooted the tree in vertex 1 and after that its height was h. In other words, h was the biggest distance between vertex 1 and some other vertex. '
b'The distance between two vertices of the tree is the number of edges on the simple path between them.'
b'Help Limak to restore his tree. Check whether there exists a tree satisfying the given conditions. Find any such tree and print its edges in any order. It\'s also possible that Limak made a mistake and there is no suitable tree\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 in this case print "-1".'
b'Input'

b'Output'
b'If there is no tree matching what Limak remembers, print the only line with "-1" (without the quotes).'
b"Otherwise, describe any tree matching Limak's description. Print n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines, each with two space-separated integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 indices of vertices connected by an edge. If there are many valid trees, print any of them. You can print edges in any order."
