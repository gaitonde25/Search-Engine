b'You are given a string ss such that each its character is either 1, 2, or 3. You have to choose the shortest contiguous substring of ss such that it contains each of these three characters at least once.'
b'A contiguous substring of string ss is a string that can be obtained from ss by removing some (possibly zero) characters from the beginning of ss and some (possibly zero) characters from the end of ss.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4200001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa420000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of one line containing the string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4200000). It is guaranteed that each character of ss is either 1, 2, or 3.'
b'The sum of lengths of all strings in all test cases does not exceed 200000200000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the shortest contiguous substring of ss containing all three types of characters at least once. If there is no such substring, print 00 instead.'
