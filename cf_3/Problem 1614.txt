b'You are given a string ss consisting only of characters + and -. You perform some process with this string. This process can be described by the following pseudocode: '
b"res = 0for init = 0 to inf    cur = init    ok = true    for i = 1 to |s|        res = res + 1        if s[i] == '+'            cur = cur + 1        else            cur = cur - 1        if cur < 0            ok = false            break    if ok        break"
b'Note that the infinf denotes infinity, and the characters of the string are numbered from 11 to |s||s|.'
b'You have to calculate the value of the resres after the process ends.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The only lines of each test case contains string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4106) consisting only of characters + and -.'
b"It's guaranteed that sum of |s||s| over all test cases doesn't exceed 106106."
b'Output'
b'For each test case print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the value of the resres after the process ends.'
