b'You have recently fallen through a hole and, after several hours of unconsciousness, have realized you are in an underground city. On one of your regular, daily walks through the unknown, you have encountered two unusually looking skeletons called Sanz and P\xe2\x80\x99pairus, who decided to accompany you and give you some puzzles for seemingly unknown reasons.'
b'One day, Sanz has created a crossword for you. Not any kind of crossword, but a 1D crossword! You are given m words and a string of length n. You are also given an array p, which designates how much each word is worth\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the i-th word is worth pi points. Whenever you find one of the m words in the string, you are given the corresponding number of points. Each position in the crossword can be used at most x times. A certain word can be counted at different places, but you cannot count the same appearance of a word multiple times. If a word is a substring of another word, you can count them both (presuming you haven\xe2\x80\x99t used the positions more than x times).'
b'In order to solve the puzzle, you need to tell Sanz what\xe2\x80\x99s the maximum achievable number of points in the crossword. There is no need to cover all postions, just get the maximal score! Crossword and words contain only lowercase English letters.'
