b"Uh oh! Applications to tech companies are due soon, and you've been procrastinating by doing contests instead! (Let's pretend for now that it is actually possible to get a job in these uncertain times.)"
b'You have completed many programming projects. In fact, there are exactly nn types of programming projects, and you have completed aiai projects of type ii. Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 has limited space, but you want to carefully choose them in such a way that maximizes your chances of getting hired.'
b"You want to include several projects of the same type to emphasize your expertise, but you also don't want to include so many that the low-quality projects start slipping in. Specifically, you determine the following quantity to be a good indicator of your chances of getting hired:"
b'f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn)=\xe2\x88\x91i=1nbi(ai\xe2\x88\x92b2i).f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn)=\xe2\x88\x91i=1nbi(ai\xe2\x88\x92bi2).'
b'Here, bibi denotes the number of projects of type ii you include in your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9. Of course, you cannot include more projects than you have completed, so you require 0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4ai0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4ai for all ii.'
b'Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 only has enough room for kk projects, and you will absolutely not be hired if your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 has empty space, so you require \xe2\x88\x91i=1nbi=k\xe2\x88\x91i=1nbi=k.'
b'Find values for b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn that maximize the value of f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn)f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn) while satisfying the above two constraints.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91i=1nai1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91i=1nai)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of types of programming projects and the r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 size, respectively.'
b'The next line contains nn integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 aiai is equal to the number of completed projects of type ii.'
b'Output'
b'In a single line, output nn integers b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn that achieve the maximum value of f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn)f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn), while satisfying the requirements 0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4ai0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4ai and \xe2\x88\x91i=1nbi=k\xe2\x88\x91i=1nbi=k. If there are multiple solutions, output any.'
b'Note that you do not have to output the value f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn)f(b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn).'
