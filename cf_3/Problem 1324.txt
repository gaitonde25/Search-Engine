b'There are nn customers in the cafeteria. Each of them wants to buy a hamburger. The ii-th customer has aiai coins, and they will buy a hamburger if it costs at most aiai coins.'
b'Suppose the cost of the hamburger is mm. Then the number of coins the cafeteria earns is mm multiplied by the number of people who buy a hamburger if it costs mm. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of coins the cafeteria can earn.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of customers.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa410121\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41012), where aiai is the number of coins the ii-th customer has.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of coins the cafeteria can earn.'
