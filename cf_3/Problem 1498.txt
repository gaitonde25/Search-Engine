b'You are given three multisets of pairs of colored sticks: '
b'  RR pairs of red sticks, the first pair has length r1r1, the second pair has length r2r2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, the RR-th pair has length rRrR;  GG pairs of green sticks, the first pair has length g1g1, the second pair has length g2g2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, the GG-th pair has length gGgG;  BB pairs of blue sticks, the first pair has length b1b1, the second pair has length b2b2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, the BB-th pair has length bBbB; '
b'You are constructing rectangles from these pairs of sticks with the following process: '
b'  take a pair of sticks of one color;  take a pair of sticks of another color different from the first one;  add the area of the resulting rectangle to the total area. '
b'Thus, you get such rectangles that their opposite sides are the same color and their adjacent sides are not the same color.'
b'Each pair of sticks can be used at most once, some pairs can be left unused. You are not allowed to split a pair into independent sticks.'
b'What is the maximum area you can achieve?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers RR, GG, BB (1\xe2\x89\xa4R,G,B\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4R,G,B\xe2\x89\xa4200)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of pairs of red sticks, the number of pairs of green sticks and the number of pairs of blue sticks.'
b'The second line contains RR integers r1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rRr1,r2,\xe2\x80\xa6,rR (1\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa42000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the lengths of sticks in each pair of red sticks.'
b'The third line contains GG integers g1,g2,\xe2\x80\xa6,gGg1,g2,\xe2\x80\xa6,gG (1\xe2\x89\xa4gi\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4gi\xe2\x89\xa42000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the lengths of sticks in each pair of green sticks.'
b'The fourth line contains BB integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bBb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bB (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa42000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the lengths of sticks in each pair of blue sticks.'
b'Output'
b'Print the maximum possible total area of the constructed rectangles.'
