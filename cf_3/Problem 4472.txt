b'Of course you have heard the famous task about Hanoi Towers, but did you know that there is a special factory producing the rings for this wonderful game? Once upon a time, the ruler of the ancient Egypt ordered the workers of Hanoi Factory to create as high tower as possible. They were not ready to serve such a strange order so they had to create this new tower using already produced rings.'
b"There are n rings in factory's stock. The i-th ring has inner radius ai, outer radius bi and height hi. The goal is to select some subset of rings and arrange them such that the following conditions are satisfied:"
b'  Outer radiuses form a non-increasing sequence, i.e. one can put the j-th ring on the i-th ring only if bj\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89bi.  Rings should not fall one into the the other. That means one can place ring j on the ring i only if bj\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89ai.  The total height of all rings used should be maximum possible. '
b'Input'
b"The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of rings in factory's stock."
b'The i-th of the next n lines contains three integers ai, bi and hi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai,\xe2\x80\x89bi,\xe2\x80\x89hi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109, bi\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x89ai)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 inner radius, outer radius and the height of the i-th ring respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum height of the tower that can be obtained.'
