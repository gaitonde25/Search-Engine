b"Let's call a binary string ss awesome, if it has at least 11 symbol 1 and length of the string is divisible by the number of 1 in it. In particular, 1, 1010, 111 are awesome, but 0, 110, 01010 aren't."
b'You are given a binary string ss. Count the number of its awesome substrings.'
b'A string aa is a substring of a string bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains the string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4200000) consisting only of zeros and ones.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of awesome substrings of ss.'
