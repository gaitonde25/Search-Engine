b'HDD hard drives group data by sectors. All files are split to fragments and each of them are written in some sector of hard drive. Note the fragments can be written in sectors in arbitrary order.'
b'One of the problems of HDD hard drives is the following: the magnetic head should move from one sector to another to read some file.'
b'Find the time need to read file split to n fragments. The i-th sector contains the fi-th fragment of the file (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89fi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n). Note different sectors contains the different fragments. At the start the magnetic head is in the position that contains the first fragment. The file are reading in the following manner: at first the first fragment is read, then the magnetic head moves to the sector that contains the second fragment, then the second fragment is read and so on until the n-th fragment is read. The fragments are read in the order from the first to the n-th.'
b'It takes |a\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89b| time units to move the magnetic head from the sector a to the sector b. Reading a fragment takes no time.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a positive integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of fragments.'
b'The second line contains n different integers fi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89fi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the fragment written in the i-th sector.'
b'Output'
b'Print the only integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of time units needed to read the file.'
