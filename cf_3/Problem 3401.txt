b'This is an interactive problem.'
b"Bob lives in a square grid of size n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n, with rows numbered 11 through nn from top to bottom, and columns numbered 11 through nn from left to right. Every cell is either allowed or blocked, but you don't know the exact description of the grid. You are given only an integer nn."
b'Bob can move through allowed cells but only in some limited directions. When Bob is in an allowed cell in the grid, he can move down or right to an adjacent cell, if it is allowed.'
b'You can ask at most 4\xe2\x8b\x85n4\xe2\x8b\x85n queries of form "? r1r1 c1c1 r2r2 c2c2" (1\xe2\x89\xa4r1\xe2\x89\xa4r2\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4r1\xe2\x89\xa4r2\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4c1\xe2\x89\xa4c2\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4c1\xe2\x89\xa4c2\xe2\x89\xa4n). The answer will be "YES" if Bob can get from a cell (r1,c1)(r1,c1) to a cell (r2,c2)(r2,c2), and "NO" otherwise. In particular, if one of the two cells (or both) is a blocked cell then the answer is "NO" for sure. Since Bob doesn\'t like short trips, you can only ask queries with the manhattan distance between the two cells at least n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921, i.e. the following condition must be satisfied: (r2\xe2\x88\x92r1)+(c2\xe2\x88\x92c1)\xe2\x89\xa5n\xe2\x88\x921(r2\xe2\x88\x92r1)+(c2\xe2\x88\x92c1)\xe2\x89\xa5n\xe2\x88\x921.'
b'It\'s guaranteed that Bob can get from the top-left corner (1,1)(1,1) to the bottom-right corner (n,n)(n,n) and your task is to find a way to do it. You should print the answer in form "! S" where SS is a string of length 2\xe2\x8b\x85n\xe2\x88\x9222\xe2\x8b\x85n\xe2\x88\x922 consisting of characters \'D\' and \'R\', denoting moves down and right respectively. The down move increases the first coordinate by 11, the right move increases the second coordinate by 11. If there are multiple solutions, any of them will be accepted. You should terminate immediately after printing the solution.'
b'Input'
b'The only line of the input contains an integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the grid.'
b'Output'
b'When you are ready to print the answer, print a single line containing "! S" where where SS is a string of length 2\xe2\x8b\x85n\xe2\x88\x9222\xe2\x8b\x85n\xe2\x88\x922 consisting of characters \'D\' and \'R\', denoting moves down and right respectively. The path should be a valid path going from the cell (1,1)(1,1) to the cell (n,n)(n,n) passing only through allowed cells.'
