b'Heidi has finally found the mythical Tree of Life \xe2\x80\x93 a legendary combinatorial structure which is said to contain a prophecy crucially needed to defeat the undead armies.'
b'On the surface, the Tree of Life is just a regular undirected tree well-known from computer science. This means that it is a collection of n points (called vertices), some of which are connected using n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 line segments (edges) so that each pair of vertices is connected by a path (a sequence of one or more edges).'
b'To decipher the prophecy, Heidi needs to perform a number of steps. The first is counting the number of lifelines in the tree \xe2\x80\x93 these are paths of length 2, i.e., consisting of two edges. Help her!'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer n \xe2\x80\x93 the number of vertices in the tree (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910000). The vertices are labeled with the numbers from 1 to n. Then n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines follow, each describing one edge using two space-separated numbers a\xe2\x80\x82b \xe2\x80\x93 the labels of the vertices connected by the edge (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n). It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x93 the number of lifelines in the tree.'
