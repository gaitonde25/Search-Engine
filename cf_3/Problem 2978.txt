b'Vasya got really tired of these credits (from problem F) and now wants to earn the money himself! He decided to make a contest to gain a profit.'
b'Vasya has nn problems to choose from. They are numbered from 11 to nn. The difficulty of the ii-th problem is didi. Moreover, the problems are given in the increasing order by their difficulties. The difficulties of all tasks are pairwise distinct. In order to add the ii-th problem to the contest you need to pay cici burles to its author. For each problem in the contest Vasya gets aa burles.'
b'In order to create a contest he needs to choose a consecutive subsegment of tasks.'
b'So the total earnings for the contest are calculated as follows: '
b'  if Vasya takes problem ii to the contest, he needs to pay cici to its author;  for each problem in the contest Vasya gets aa burles;  let gap(l,r)=maxl\xe2\x89\xa4i<r(di+1\xe2\x88\x92di)2gap(l,r)=maxl\xe2\x89\xa4i<r(di+1\xe2\x88\x92di)2. If Vasya takes all the tasks with indices from ll to rr to the contest, he also needs to pay gap(l,r)gap(l,r). If l=rl=r then gap(l,r)=0gap(l,r)=0. '
b'Calculate the maximum profit that Vasya can earn by taking a consecutive segment of tasks.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and aa (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of proposed tasks and the profit for a single problem, respectively.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains two integers didi and cici (1\xe2\x89\xa4di,ci\xe2\x89\xa4109,di<di+11\xe2\x89\xa4di,ci\xe2\x89\xa4109,di<di+1).'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 maximum amount of burles Vasya can earn.'
