b"You are given a correct solution of the sudoku puzzle. If you don't know what is the sudoku, you can read about it here."
b'The picture showing the correct sudoku solution:'
b''
b'Blocks are bordered with bold black color.'
b'Your task is to change at most 99 elements of this field (i.e. choose some 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa491\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa49 and change the number at the position (i,j)(i,j) to any other number in range [1;9][1;9]) to make it anti-sudoku. The anti-sudoku is the 9\xc3\x9799\xc3\x979 field, in which:'
b'  Any number in this field is in range [1;9][1;9];  each row contains at least two equal elements;  each column contains at least two equal elements;  each 3\xc3\x9733\xc3\x973 block (you can read what is the block in the link above) contains at least two equal elements. '
b'It is guaranteed that the answer exists.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case consists of 99 lines, each line consists of 99 characters from 11 to 99 without any whitespaces \xe2\x80\x94 the correct solution of the sudoku puzzle.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the answer \xe2\x80\x94 the initial field with at most 99 changed elements so that the obtained field is anti-sudoku. If there are several solutions, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.'
