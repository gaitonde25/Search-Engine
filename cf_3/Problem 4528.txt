b'"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.

I pledge my life and honor to the Night\'s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come." \xe2\x80\x94 The Night\'s Watch oath.'
