b'Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.'
b'Let us denote the cell with coordinates ii vertically and jj horizontally by (i,j)(i,j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1,1)(1,1) and the lower right cell as (n,m)(n,m).'
b'Casimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size dd (d>0d>0) with its center in cell (i,j)(i,j) is drawn as follows: '
b'  First, the center cell (i,j)(i,j) is painted black.  Then exactly dd cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly dd cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black.  That is all the cells with coordinates (i\xe2\x88\x92h,j\xc2\xb1h)(i\xe2\x88\x92h,j\xc2\xb1h) for all hh between 00 and dd are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d+12d+1 black cells. '
b'An already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4\xc3\x9794\xc3\x979 box, with two ticks of sizes 22 and 33.'
b'  '
b'You are given a description of a checkered field of size n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 00) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least kk (that is, d\xe2\x89\xa5kd\xe2\x89\xa5k for all the ticks).'
b'Determine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d\xe2\x89\xa5kd\xe2\x89\xa5k or not.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number test cases.'
b'The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. '
b"The first line of the test case description contains the integers nn, mm, and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410; 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4191\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa419)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following nn lines describe the field: each line consists of mm characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise."
b'Output'
b'Print tt lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.'
b'You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).'
