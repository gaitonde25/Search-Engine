b'Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sns1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sn, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns, and Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a contiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them with X. Alice must select a substing of length aa, and Bob must select a substring of length bb. It is guaranteed that a>ba>b.'
b"For example, if s=s= ...X.. and a=3a=3, b=2b=2, then after Alice's move string can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string s=s= ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or ...XXX."
b'Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who wins if they both play optimally.'
b'You have to answer qq independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries.'
b'The first line of each query contains two integers aa and bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4b<a\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4b<a\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'The second line of each query contains the string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105), consisting of only characters . and X.'
b'It is guaranteed that sum of all |s||s| over all queries not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO otherwise.'
b'You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).'
