b'You are given a binary matrix aa of size n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m. A binary matrix is a matrix where each element is either 00 or 11.'
b'You may perform some (possibly zero) operations with this matrix. During each operation you can inverse the row of this matrix or a column of this matrix. Formally, inverting a row is changing all values in this row to the opposite (00 to 11, 11 to 00). Inverting a column is changing all values in this column to the opposite.'
b'Your task is to sort the initial matrix by some sequence of such operations. The matrix is considered sorted if the array [a1,1,a1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a1,m,a2,1,a2,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a2,m,\xe2\x80\xa6,an,m\xe2\x88\x921,an,m][a1,1,a1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a1,m,a2,1,a2,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,a2,m,\xe2\x80\xa6,an,m\xe2\x88\x921,an,m] is sorted in non-descending order.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4200) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix.'
b'The next nn lines contain mm integers each. The jj-th element in the ii-th line is ai,jai,j (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa41) \xe2\x80\x94 the element of aa at position (i,j)(i,j).'
b'Output'
b'If it is impossible to obtain a sorted matrix, print "NO" in the first line.'
b'Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. In the second line print a string rr of length nn. The ii-th character riri of this string should be \'1\' if the ii-th row of the matrix is inverted and \'0\' otherwise. In the third line print a string cc of length mm. The jj-th character cjcj of this string should be \'1\' if the jj-th column of the matrix is inverted and \'0\' otherwise. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.'
