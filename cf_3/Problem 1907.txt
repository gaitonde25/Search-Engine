b"Ehab has an array aa of length nn. He has just enough free time to make a new array consisting of nn copies of the old array, written back-to-back. What will be the length of the new array's longest increasing subsequence?"
b'A sequence aa is a subsequence of an array bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence of an array is the longest subsequence such that its elements are ordered in strictly increasing order.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the array aa.'
b'The second line contains nn space-separated integers a1a1, a2a2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array aa.'
b"The sum of nn across the test cases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each testcase, output the length of the longest increasing subsequence of aa if you concatenate it to itself nn times.'
