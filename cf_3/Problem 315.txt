b'Polycarp got an array of integers a[1\xe2\x80\xa6n]a[1\xe2\x80\xa6n] as a gift. Now he wants to perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that all elements of the array become the same (that is, to become a1=a2=\xe2\x8b\xaf=ana1=a2=\xe2\x8b\xaf=an).'
b' In one operation, he can take some indices in the array and increase the elements of the array at those indices by 11.'
b'For example, let a=[4,2,1,6,2]a=[4,2,1,6,2]. He can perform the following operation: select indices 1, 2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by 11. As a result, in one operation, he can get a new state of the array a=[5,3,1,7,2]a=[5,3,1,7,2].'
b'What is the minimum number of operations it can take so that all elements of the array become equal to each other (that is, to become a1=a2=\xe2\x8b\xaf=ana1=a2=\xe2\x8b\xaf=an)?'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the test.'
b'The following are descriptions of the input test cases.'
b'The first line of the description of each test case contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the array aa.'
b'The second line of the description of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 elements of the array aa.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print one integer \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array aa equal.'
