b'You are given nn strings a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an: all of them have the same length mm. The strings consist of lowercase English letters.'
b'Find any string ss of length mm such that each of the given nn strings differs from ss in at most one position. Formally, for each given string aiai, there is no more than one position jj such that ai[j]\xe2\x89\xa0s[j]ai[j]\xe2\x89\xa0s[j].'
b'Note that the desired string ss may be equal to one of the given strings aiai, or it may differ from all the given strings.'
b'For example, if you have the strings abac and zbab, then the answer to the problem might be the string abab, which differs from the first only by the last character, and from the second only by the first.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case starts with a line containing two positive integers nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410) and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa410)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of strings and their length.'
b'Then follow nn strings aiai, one per line. Each of them has length mm and consists of lowercase English letters.'
b'Output'
b'Print tt answers to the test cases. Each answer (if it exists) is a string of length mm consisting of lowercase English letters. If there are several answers, print any of them. If the answer does not exist, print "-1" ("minus one", without quotes).'
