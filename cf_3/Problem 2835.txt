b"Each day in Berland consists of nn hours. Polycarp likes time management. That's why he has a fixed schedule for each day \xe2\x80\x94 it is a sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (each aiai is either 00 or 11), where ai=0ai=0 if Polycarp works during the ii-th hour of the day and ai=1ai=1 if Polycarp rests during the ii-th hour of the day."
b'Days go one after another endlessly and Polycarp uses the same schedule for each day.'
b'What is the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests? It is guaranteed that there is at least one working hour in a day.'

b'Output'
b'Print the maximal number of continuous hours during which Polycarp rests. Remember that you should consider that days go one after another endlessly and Polycarp uses the same schedule for each day.'
