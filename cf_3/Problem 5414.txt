b"Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. He is now investigating a case of frauds who make fake copies of the famous Stolp's gears, puzzles that are as famous as the Rubik's cube once was."
b'Its most important components are a button and a line of n similar gears. Each gear has n teeth containing all numbers from 0 to n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 in the counter-clockwise order. When you push a button, the first gear rotates clockwise, then the second gear rotates counter-clockwise, the the third gear rotates clockwise an so on.'
b'Besides, each gear has exactly one active tooth. When a gear turns, a new active tooth is the one following after the current active tooth according to the direction of the rotation. For example, if n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895, and the active tooth is the one containing number 0, then clockwise rotation makes the tooth with number 1 active, or the counter-clockwise rotating makes the tooth number 4 active.'
b'Andrewid remembers that the real puzzle has the following property: you can push the button multiple times in such a way that in the end the numbers on the active teeth of the gears from first to last form sequence 0,\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891. Write a program that determines whether the given puzzle is real or fake.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of gears.'
b'The second line contains n digits a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891) \xe2\x80\x94 the sequence of active teeth: the active tooth of the i-th gear contains number ai.'
b'Output'
b'In a single line print "Yes" (without the quotes), if the given Stolp\'s gears puzzle is real, and "No" (without the quotes) otherwise.'
