b"One day n friends met at a party, they hadn't seen each other for a long time and so they decided to make a group photo together. "
b'Simply speaking, the process of taking photos can be described as follows. On the photo, each photographed friend occupies a rectangle of pixels: the i-th of them occupies the rectangle of width wi pixels and height hi pixels. On the group photo everybody stands in a line, thus the minimum pixel size of the photo including all the photographed friends, is W\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x89H, where W is the total sum of all widths and H is the maximum height of all the photographed friends.'
b'As is usually the case, the friends made n photos \xe2\x80\x94 the j-th (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89j\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) photo had everybody except for the j-th friend as he was the photographer.'
b'Print the minimum size of each made photo in pixels. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89200\xe2\x80\x89000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of friends. '
b'Then n lines follow: the i-th line contains information about the i-th friend. The line contains a pair of integers wi,\xe2\x80\x89hi (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89wi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910,\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89hi\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891000) \xe2\x80\x94 the width and height in pixels of the corresponding rectangle.'
b'Output'
b'Print n space-separated numbers b1,\xe2\x80\x89b2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89bn, where bi \xe2\x80\x94 the total number of pixels on the minimum photo containing all friends expect for the i-th one.'
