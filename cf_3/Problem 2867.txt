b'You are a coach at your local university. There are nn students under your supervision, the programming skill of the ii-th student is aiai.'
b'You have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than 55.'
b'Your task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.'
