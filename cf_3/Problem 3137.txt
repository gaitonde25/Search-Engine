b'Chouti and his classmates are going to the university soon. To say goodbye to each other, the class has planned a big farewell party in which classmates, teachers and parents sang and danced.'
b'Chouti remembered that nn persons took part in that party. To make the party funnier, each person wore one hat among nn kinds of weird hats numbered 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6n. It is possible that several persons wore hats of the same kind. Some kinds of hats can remain unclaimed by anyone.'
b'After the party, the ii-th person said that there were aiai persons wearing a hat differing from his own.'
b"It has been some days, so Chouti forgot all about others' hats, but he is curious about that. Let bibi be the number of hat type the ii-th person was wearing, Chouti wants you to find any possible b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn that doesn't contradict with any person's statement. Because some persons might have a poor memory, there could be no solution at all."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105), the number of persons in the party.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921), the statements of people.'
b'Output'
b'If there is no solution, print a single line "Impossible".'
b'Otherwise, print "Possible" and then nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
