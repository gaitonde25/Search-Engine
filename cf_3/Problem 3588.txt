b'There are nn players numbered from 00 to n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 with ranks. The ii-th player has rank ii.'
b'Players can form teams: the team should consist of three players and no pair of players in the team should have a conflict. The rank of the team is calculated using the following algorithm: let ii, jj, kk be the ranks of players in the team and i<j<ki<j<k, then the rank of the team is equal to A\xe2\x8b\x85i+B\xe2\x8b\x85j+C\xe2\x8b\x85kA\xe2\x8b\x85i+B\xe2\x8b\x85j+C\xe2\x8b\x85k.'
b'You are given information about the pairs of players who have a conflict. Calculate the total sum of ranks over all possible valid teams modulo 264264.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two space-separated integers nn and mm (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851050\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of players and the number of conflicting pairs.'
b'The second line contains three space-separated integers AA, BB and CC (1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 coefficients for team rank calculation.'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two space-separated integers uiui and vivi (0\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi<n,ui\xe2\x89\xa0vi0\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi<n,ui\xe2\x89\xa0vi) \xe2\x80\x94 pair of conflicting players.'
b"It's guaranteed that each unordered pair of players appears in the input file no more than once."
b'Output'
b'Print single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the total sum of ranks over all possible teams modulo 264264.'
