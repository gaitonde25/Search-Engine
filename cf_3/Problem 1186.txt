b'You have a robot that can move along a number line. At time moment 00 it stands at point 00.'
b'You give nn commands to the robot: at time titi seconds you command the robot to go to point xixi. Whenever the robot receives a command, it starts moving towards the point xixi with the speed of 11 unit per second, and he stops when he reaches that point. However, while the robot is moving, it ignores all the other commands that you give him.'
b'For example, suppose you give three commands to the robot: at time 11 move to point 55, at time 33 move to point 00 and at time 66 move to point 44. Then the robot stands at 00 until time 11, then starts moving towards 55, ignores the second command, reaches 55 at time 66 and immediately starts moving to 44 to execute the third command. At time 77 it reaches 44 and stops there.'
b'You call the command ii successful, if there is a time moment in the range [ti,ti+1][ti,ti+1] (i.\xc2\xa0e. after you give this command and before you give another one, both bounds inclusive; we consider tn+1=+\xe2\x88\x9etn+1=+\xe2\x88\x9e) when the robot is at point xixi. Count the number of successful commands. Note that it is possible that an ignored command is successful.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The next lines describe the test cases.'
b'The first line of a test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of commands.'
b'The next nn lines describe the commands. The ii-th of these lines contains two integers titi and xixi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa4109, \xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the time and the point of the ii-th command.'
b'The commands are ordered by time, that is, ti<ti+1ti<ti+1 for all possible ii.'
b'The sum of nn over test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each testcase output a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of successful commands.'
