b'A large-scale conference on unnatural sciences is going to be held soon in Berland! In total, nn scientists from all around the world have applied. All of them have indicated a time segment when they will attend the conference: two integers lili, riri \xe2\x80\x94 day of arrival and day of departure.'
b'Also, some of the scientists have indicated their country, while some preferred not to. So, each scientist also has a value cici, where:'
b'  ci>0ci>0, if the scientist is coming from country cici (all countries are numbered from 11 to 200200);  ci=0ci=0, if the scientist preferred to not indicate the country. '
b'Everyone knows that it is interesting and useful to chat with representatives of other countries! A participant of the conference will be upset if she will not meet people from other countries during the stay. It is possible to meet people during all time of stay, including the day of arrival and the day of departure.'
b'Conference organizers need to be ready for the worst! They are interested in the largest number xx, that it is possible that among all people attending the conference exactly xx will be upset.'
b'Help the organizers to find the maximum number of upset scientists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of registered conference participants.'
b'Next nn lines follow, each containing three integers lili, riri, cici (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4106, 0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa42000\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4200) \xe2\x80\x94 the day of arrival, the day of departure and the country (or the fact that it was not indicated) for the ii-th participant.'
b'The sum of nn among all test cases in the input does not exceed 500500.'
b'Output'
b'Output tt integers \xe2\x80\x94 maximum number of upset scientists for each test case.'
