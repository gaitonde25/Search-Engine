b"Let's say string ss has period kk if si=si+ksi=si+k for all ii from 11 to |s|\xe2\x88\x92k|s|\xe2\x88\x92k (|s||s| means length of string ss) and kk is the minimum positive integer with this property."
b'Some examples of a period: for ss="0101" the period is k=2k=2, for ss="0000" the period is k=1k=1, for ss="010" the period is k=2k=2, for ss="0011" the period is k=4k=4.'
b"You are given string tt consisting only of 0's and 1's and you need to find such string ss that:"
b"  String ss consists only of 0's and 1's;  The length of ss doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85|t|2\xe2\x8b\x85|t|;  String tt is a subsequence of string ss;  String ss has smallest possible period among all strings that meet conditions 1\xe2\x80\x943. "
b'Let us recall that tt is a subsequence of ss if tt can be derived from ss by deleting zero or more elements (any) without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, tt="011" is a subsequence of ss="10101".'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains single integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b"Next TT lines contain test cases \xe2\x80\x94 one per line. Each line contains string tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4|t|\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4|t|\xe2\x89\xa4100) consisting only of 0's and 1's."
b'Output'
b'Print one string for each test case \xe2\x80\x94 string ss you needed to find. If there are multiple solutions print any one of them.'
