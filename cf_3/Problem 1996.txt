b'This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543'
b'You run a string shop. During a day your customers want to buy strings of certain lengths and sometimes satisfying other properties.'
b'You have a string of length nn and can cut a string of any length starting at any position out of it. Today your first customer asks you some questions of type "Is there any difference between substrings of length kk if one of them starts at position ii and another one starts from the jj-th position?" You are to answer all these questions.'
b'Please note that in your shop strings are over an alphabet of size 987898789987898789.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q,n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4q,n\xe2\x89\xa4200000). The second line contains nn space-separated integers a1a1, ..., anan (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai<9878987890\xe2\x89\xa4ai<987898789) which denote the letters of string ss, and each of the following qq lines contains three integers lenlen, pos1pos1 and pos2pos2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4len\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4len\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4pos1,pos2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92len+11\xe2\x89\xa4pos1,pos2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x92len+1) denoting the corresponding query.'
b'Output'
b'Print qq lines, ii-th of them containing Yes if the two substrings in the ii-th query (of length lenlen starting from pos1pos1 and pos2pos2) are equal and No otherwise.'
