b'Alice and Bob are playing a game with strings. There will be tt rounds in the game. In each round, there will be a string ss consisting of lowercase English letters. '
b'Alice moves first and both the players take alternate turns. Alice is allowed to remove any substring of even length (possibly empty) and Bob is allowed to remove any substring of odd length from ss.'
b'More formally, if there was a string s=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sks=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sk the player can choose a substring slsl+1\xe2\x80\xa6sr\xe2\x88\x921srslsl+1\xe2\x80\xa6sr\xe2\x88\x921sr with length of corresponding parity and remove it. After that the string will become s=s1\xe2\x80\xa6sl\xe2\x88\x921sr+1\xe2\x80\xa6sks=s1\xe2\x80\xa6sl\xe2\x88\x921sr+1\xe2\x80\xa6sk.'
b"After the string becomes empty, the round ends and each player calculates his/her score for this round. The score of a player is the sum of values of all characters removed by him/her. The value of aa is 11, the value of bb is 22, the value of cc is 33, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, and the value of zz is 2626. The player with higher score wins the round. For each round, determine the winner and the difference between winner's and loser's scores. Assume that both players play optimally to maximize their score. It can be proved that a draw is impossible."
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104) denoting the number of rounds.'
b'Each of the next tt lines contain a single string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) consisting of lowercase English letters, denoting the string used for the round. Here |s||s| denotes the length of the string ss.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of |s||s| over all rounds does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each round, print a single line containing a string and an integer. If Alice wins the round, the string must be "Alice". If Bob wins the round, the string must be "Bob". The integer must be the difference between their scores assuming both players play optimally.'
