b'There are nn cities and n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 two-way roads in Treeland. Each road connects a pair of different cities. From any city you can drive to any other, moving only along the roads. Cities are numbered from 11 to nn. Yes, of course, you recognized an undirected tree in this description.'
b'There is exactly one flag in each city, in the ii-th city the flag color is cici. The colors of the flags in different cities may be the same.'
b'If the King travels along the route [u1,u2,u3,\xe2\x80\xa6,uk][u1,u2,u3,\xe2\x80\xa6,uk], then this means that he starts in the city u1u1, then moves to the city u2u2 (u2u2 is connected by road with u1u1), then from u2u2 to u3u3 (u3u3 is connected by road to u2u2), and so on until he arrives in the city of ukuk. It is possible that during this route the King will visit the same city more than once. In other words, the route [u1,u2,u3,\xe2\x80\xa6,uk][u1,u2,u3,\xe2\x80\xa6,uk] does not necessarily consist of different cities. In terms of graph theory \xe2\x80\x94 the King moves from u1u1 to ukuk along some path [u1,u2,u3,\xe2\x80\xa6,uk][u1,u2,u3,\xe2\x80\xa6,uk], which is not necessarily simple (for all jj from 11 to k\xe2\x88\x921k\xe2\x88\x921 of the city ujuj and uj+1uj+1 are connected by road).'
b'When the King moves from one city to another, city heads exchange flags as a sign of their friendship.'
b'  Example of moving the King along the route [1,4,2,6][1,4,2,6]. The color of the vertex matches the color of the flag at that vertex. '
b'For aesthetic reasons, the King wants the flag color in the city ii to be equal to didi for all ii from 11 to nn. Determine whether the King can choose some route and drive along it so that for each city the flag color in it turns out to be equal to the desired color didi. Note that the King can choose (and drive) exactly one route. If yes, find the shortest possible route for the King.'
b"If the initial colors of the flags already match the King's requirements (i.e. ci=dici=di for all ii), then consider that the King makes a route of length k=0k=0."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases to solve. The following are the cases.'
b'Each case begins with a line containing an integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities in Treeland.'
b"The following is a line of nn integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4106), where cici denotes the color of the flag at the ii-th vertex before the King's journey."
b"The following is a line of nn integers d1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dnd1,d2,\xe2\x80\xa6,dn (1\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4106), where didi denotes the required flag color at the ii-th vertex after the completion of the King's journey."
b"Further, in the n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 line, the Treeland's roads are listed. Each road is given by a line containing two integers xj,yjxj,yj (1\xe2\x89\xa4xj,yj\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xj,yj\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 numbers of cities that are connected by the jj th road."
b'It is guaranteed that from every city you can get to any other by road (in other words, the system of cities and roads forms an undirected tree).'
b'The sum of all nn values \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bfor all cases in one test does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'Print the answers to all cases in the order of their appearance in the input data.'
b'Each answer must begin with a line containing "Yes" (in the case of a positive answer) or "No" (in the case that the required route does not exist). In the case of a positive answer, the following line must contain an integer kk \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities in the shortest possible route of the King. The next line should contain the required route u1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uku1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uk (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui\xe2\x89\xa4n). You can skip the line if k=0k=0.'
