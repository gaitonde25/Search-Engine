b"The leader of some very secretive organization has decided to invite all other members to a meeting. All members of the organization live in the same town which can be represented as nn crossroads connected by mm two-directional streets. The meeting will be held in the leader's house near the crossroad 11. There are kk members of the organization invited to the meeting; ii-th of them lives near the crossroad aiai. "
b"All members of the organization receive the message about the meeting at the same moment and start moving to the location where the meeting is held. In the beginning of each minute each person is located at some crossroad. He or she can either wait a minute at this crossroad, or spend a minute to walk from the current crossroad along some street to another crossroad (obviously, it is possible to start walking along the street only if it begins or ends at the current crossroad). In the beginning of the first minute each person is at the crossroad where he or she lives. As soon as a person reaches the crossroad number 11, he or she immediately comes to the leader's house and attends the meeting."
b"Obviously, the leader wants all other members of the organization to come up as early as possible. But, since the organization is very secretive, the leader does not want to attract much attention. Let's denote the discontent of the leader as follows"
b'  initially the discontent is 00;  whenever a person reaches the crossroad number 11, the discontent of the leader increases by c\xe2\x8b\x85xc\xe2\x8b\x85x, where cc is some fixed constant, and xx is the number of minutes it took the person to reach the crossroad number 11;  whenever xx members of the organization walk along the same street at the same moment in the same direction, dx2dx2 is added to the discontent, where dd is some fixed constant. This is not cumulative: for example, if two persons are walking along the same street in the same direction at the same moment, then 4d4d is added to the discontent, not 5d5d. '
b'Before sending a message about the meeting, the leader can tell each member of the organization which path they should choose and where they should wait. Help the leader to establish a plan for every member of the organization so they all reach the crossroad 11, and the discontent is minimized.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains five integer numbers nn, mm, kk, cc and dd (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4502\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450, n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa450n\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa450, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k,c,d\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4k,c,d\xe2\x89\xa450) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of crossroads, the number of streets, the number of persons invited to the meeting and the constants affecting the discontent, respectively.'
b'The second line contains kk numbers a1a1, a2a2, ..., akak (2\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n2\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the crossroads where the members of the organization live.'
b'Then mm lines follow, each denoting a bidirectional street. Each line contains two integers xixi and yiyi (1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4n, xi\xe2\x89\xa0yixi\xe2\x89\xa0yi) denoting a street connecting crossroads xixi and yiyi. There may be multiple streets connecting the same pair of crossroads.'
b'It is guaranteed that every crossroad can be reached from every other crossroad using the given streets. '
b'Output'
b'Print one integer: the minimum discontent of the leader after everyone reaches crossroad 11.'
