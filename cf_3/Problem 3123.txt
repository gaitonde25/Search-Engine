b"The Fair Nut is going to travel to the Tree Country, in which there are nn cities. Most of the land of this country is covered by forest. Furthermore, the local road system forms a tree (connected graph without cycles). Nut wants to rent a car in the city uu and go by a simple path to city vv. He hasn't determined the path, so it's time to do it. Note that chosen path can consist of only one vertex."
b"A filling station is located in every city. Because of strange law, Nut can buy only wiwi liters of gasoline in the ii-th city. We can assume, that he has infinite money. Each road has a length, and as soon as Nut drives through this road, the amount of gasoline decreases by length. Of course, Nut can't choose a path, which consists of roads, where he runs out of gasoline. He can buy gasoline in every visited city, even in the first and the last."
b'He also wants to find the maximum amount of gasoline that he can have at the end of the path. Help him: count it.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities.'
b'The second line contains nn integers w1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wnw1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wn (0\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum amounts of liters of gasoline that Nut can buy in cities.'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describes road and contains three integers uu, vv, cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4109, u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v), where uu and vv\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 cities that are connected by this road and cc\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 its length.'
b'It is guaranteed that graph of road connectivity is a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print one number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum amount of gasoline that he can have at the end of the path.'
