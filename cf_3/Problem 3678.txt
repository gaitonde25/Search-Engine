b'You are given a following process. '
b'There is a platform with nn columns. 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 squares are appearing one after another in some columns on this platform. If there are no squares in the column, a square will occupy the bottom row. Otherwise a square will appear at the top of the highest square of this column. '
b'When all of the nn columns have at least one square in them, the bottom row is being removed. You will receive 11 point for this, and all the squares left will fall down one row. '
b'You task is to calculate the amount of points you will receive.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contain 2 integer numbers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the platform and the number of the squares.'
b'The next line contain mm integer numbers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cmc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cm (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 column in which ii-th square will appear.'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the amount of points you will receive.'
