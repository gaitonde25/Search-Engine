b'You are given a string ss of length nn, which consists only of the first kk letters of the Latin alphabet. All letters in string ss are uppercase.'
b'A subsequence of string ss is a string that can be derived from ss by deleting some of its symbols without changing the order of the remaining symbols. For example, "ADE" and "BD" are subsequences of "ABCDE", but "DEA" is not.'
b'A subsequence of ss called good if the number of occurences of each of the first kk letters of the alphabet is the same.'
b'Find the length of the longest good subsequence of ss. '
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains integers nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4261\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa426).'
b"The second line of the input contains the string ss of length nn. String ss only contains uppercase letters from 'A' to the kk-th letter of Latin alphabet."
b'Output'
b'Print the only integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the longest good subsequence of string ss.'
