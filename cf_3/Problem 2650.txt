b"Authors guessed an array aa consisting of nn integers; each integer is not less than 22 and not greater than 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105. You don't know the array aa, but you know the array bb which is formed from it with the following sequence of operations:"
b'  Firstly, let the array bb be equal to the array aa;  Secondly, for each ii from 11 to nn:   if aiai is a prime number, then one integer paipai is appended to array bb, where pp is an infinite sequence of prime numbers (2,3,5,\xe2\x80\xa62,3,5,\xe2\x80\xa6);  otherwise (if aiai is not a prime number), the greatest divisor of aiai which is not equal to aiai is appended to bb;   Then the obtained array of length 2n2n is shuffled and given to you in the input. '
b'Here paipai means the aiai-th prime number. The first prime p1=2p1=2, the second one is p2=3p2=3, and so on.'
b'Your task is to recover any suitable array aa that forms the given array bb. It is guaranteed that the answer exists (so the array bb is obtained from some suitable array aa). If there are multiple answers, you can print any.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in aa.'
b'The second line of the input contains 2n2n integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,b2nb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,b2n (2\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa427501312\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa42750131), where bibi is the ii-th element of bb. 27501312750131 is the 199999199999-th prime number.'
b'Output'
b'In the only line of the output print nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (2\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) in any order \xe2\x80\x94 the array aa from which the array bb can be obtained using the sequence of moves given in the problem statement. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.'
