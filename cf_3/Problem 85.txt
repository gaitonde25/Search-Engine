b'You are given a tree (connected, undirected, acyclic graph) with nn vertices. Two edges are adjacent if they share exactly one endpoint. In one move you can remove an arbitrary edge, if that edge is adjacent to an even number of remaining edges.'
b'Remove all of the edges, or determine that it is impossible. If there are multiple solutions, print any.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b'Then n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. The ii-th of them contains two integers uiui, vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n) the endpoints of the ii-th edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print "NO" if it is impossible to remove all the edges.'
b'Otherwise print "YES", and in the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines print a possible order of the removed edges. For each edge, print its endpoints in any order.'
