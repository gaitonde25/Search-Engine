b'In the Bus of Characters there are nn rows of seat, each having 22 seats. The width of both seats in the ii-th row is wiwi centimeters. All integers wiwi are distinct.'
b'Initially the bus is empty. On each of 2n2n stops one passenger enters the bus. There are two types of passengers: '
b'  an introvert always chooses a row where both seats are empty. Among these rows he chooses the one with the smallest seats width and takes one of the seats in it;  an extrovert always chooses a row where exactly one seat is occupied (by an introvert). Among these rows he chooses the one with the largest seats width and takes the vacant place in it. '
b'You are given the seats width in each row and the order the passengers enter the bus. Determine which row each passenger will take.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows in the bus.'
b'The second line contains the sequence of integers w1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wnw1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wn (1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4109), where wiwi is the width of each of the seats in the ii-th row. It is guaranteed that all wiwi are distinct.'
b"The third line contains a string of length 2n2n, consisting of digits '0' and '1' \xe2\x80\x94 the description of the order the passengers enter the bus. If the jj-th character is '0', then the passenger that enters the bus on the jj-th stop is an introvert. If the jj-th character is '1', the the passenger that enters the bus on the jj-th stop is an extrovert. It is guaranteed that the number of extroverts equals the number of introverts (i.\xc2\xa0e. both numbers equal nn), and for each extrovert there always is a suitable row."
b'Output'
b'Print 2n2n integers \xe2\x80\x94 the rows the passengers will take. The order of passengers should be the same as in input.'
