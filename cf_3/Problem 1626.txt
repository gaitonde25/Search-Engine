b'A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve it!'
b'You are given integers n,kn,k. Construct a grid AA with size n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n consisting of integers 00 and 11. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly kk. In other words, the number of 11 in the grid is equal to kk.'
b"Let's define:"
b"  Ai,jAi,j as the integer in the ii-th row and the jj-th column.  Ri=Ai,1+Ai,2+...+Ai,nRi=Ai,1+Ai,2+...+Ai,n (for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n).  Cj=A1,j+A2,j+...+An,jCj=A1,j+A2,j+...+An,j (for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4n).  In other words, RiRi are row sums and CjCj are column sums of the grid AA.  For the grid AA let's define the value f(A)=(max(R)\xe2\x88\x92min(R))2+(max(C)\xe2\x88\x92min(C))2f(A)=(max(R)\xe2\x88\x92min(R))2+(max(C)\xe2\x88\x92min(C))2 (here for an integer sequence XX we define max(X)max(X) as the maximum value in XX and min(X)min(X) as the minimum value in XX). "
b'Find any grid AA, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value f(A)f(A) is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next tt lines contain descriptions of test cases.'
b'For each test case the only line contains two integers nn, kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4300,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n2)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4300,0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n2).'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of n2n2 for all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, firstly print the minimum possible value of f(A)f(A) among all tables, for which the condition is satisfied.'
b'After that, print nn lines contain nn characters each. The jj-th character in the ii-th line should be equal to Ai,jAi,j.'
b'If there are multiple answers you can print any.'
