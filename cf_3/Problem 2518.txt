b'For years, the Day of city N was held in the most rainy day of summer. New mayor decided to break this tradition and select a not-so-rainy day for the celebration. The mayor knows the weather forecast for the nn days of summer. On the ii-th day, aiai millimeters of rain will fall. All values aiai are distinct.'
b'The mayor knows that citizens will watch the weather xx days before the celebration and yy days after. Because of that, he says that a day dd is not-so-rainy if adad is smaller than rain amounts at each of xx days before day dd and and each of yy days after day dd. In other words, ad<ajad<aj should hold for all d\xe2\x88\x92x\xe2\x89\xa4j<dd\xe2\x88\x92x\xe2\x89\xa4j<d and d<j\xe2\x89\xa4d+yd<j\xe2\x89\xa4d+y. Citizens only watch the weather during summer, so we only consider such jj that 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4n.'
b'Help mayor find the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, xx and yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000, 0\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa470\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa47)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of days in summer, the number of days citizens watch the weather before the celebration and the number of days they do that after.'
