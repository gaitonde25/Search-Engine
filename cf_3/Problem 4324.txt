b'Alice got tired of playing the tag game by the usual rules so she offered Bob a little modification to it. Now the game should be played on an undirected rooted tree of n vertices. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.'
b'Alice starts at vertex 1 and Bob starts at vertex x (x\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x891). The moves are made in turns, Bob goes first. In one move one can either stay at the current vertex or travel to the neighbouring one.'
b'The game ends when Alice goes to the same vertex where Bob is standing. Alice wants to minimize the total number of moves and Bob wants to maximize it.'
b'You should write a program which will determine how many moves will the game last.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integer numbers n and x (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105, 2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n).'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines contains two integer numbers a and b (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) \xe2\x80\x94 edges of the tree. It is guaranteed that the edges form a valid tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print the total number of moves Alice and Bob will make.'
