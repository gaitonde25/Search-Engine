b'Alice and Bob play the following game. Alice has a set SS of disjoint ranges of integers, initially containing only one range [1,n][1,n]. In one turn, Alice picks a range [l,r][l,r] from the set SS and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number dd (l\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4rl\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4r). Then Alice removes [l,r][l,r] from SS and puts into the set SS the range [l,d\xe2\x88\x921][l,d\xe2\x88\x921] (if l\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x88\x921l\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x88\x921) and the range [d+1,r][d+1,r] (if d+1\xe2\x89\xa4rd+1\xe2\x89\xa4r). The game ends when the set SS is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly nn.'
b"After playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges [l,r][l,r] she picked from the set SS, but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers dd from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill."
b'Given the list of ranges that Alice has picked ([l,r][l,r]), for each range, help Bob find the number dd that Bob has picked.'
b'We can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000). Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000).'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains two integers ll and rr (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4n), denoting the range [l,r][l,r] that Alice picked at some point.'
b'Note that the ranges are given in no particular order.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 10001000, and the ranges for each test case are from a valid game.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case print nn lines. Each line should contain three integers ll, rr, and dd, denoting that for Alice's range [l,r][l,r] Bob picked the number dd."
b'You can print the lines in any order. We can show that the answer is unique.'
b'It is not required to print a new line after each test case. The new lines in the output of the example are for readability only. '
