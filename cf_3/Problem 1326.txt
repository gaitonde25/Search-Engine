b"Recently you've discovered a new shooter. They say it has realistic game mechanics."
b'Your character has a gun with magazine size equal to kk and should exterminate nn waves of monsters. The ii-th wave consists of aiai monsters and happens from the lili-th moment of time up to the riri-th moments of time. All aiai monsters spawn at moment lili and you have to exterminate all of them before the moment riri ends (you can kill monsters right at moment riri). For every two consecutive waves, the second wave starts not earlier than the first wave ends (though the second wave can start at the same moment when the first wave ends) \xe2\x80\x94 formally, the condition ri\xe2\x89\xa4li+1ri\xe2\x89\xa4li+1 holds. Take a look at the notes for the examples to understand the process better.'
b"You are confident in yours and your character's skills so you can assume that aiming and shooting are instant and you need exactly one bullet to kill one monster. But reloading takes exactly 11 unit of time."
b"One of the realistic mechanics is a mechanic of reloading: when you reload you throw away the old magazine with all remaining bullets in it. That's why constant reloads may cost you excessive amounts of spent bullets."
b"You've taken a liking to this mechanic so now you are wondering: what is the minimum possible number of bullets you need to spend (both used and thrown) to exterminate all waves."
b"Note that you don't throw the remaining bullets away after eradicating all monsters, and you start with a full magazine."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa420001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000; 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of waves and magazine size.'
b'The next nn lines contain descriptions of waves. The ii-th line contains three integers lili, riri and aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4109; 1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the period of time when the ii-th wave happens and the number of monsters in it.'
b"It's guaranteed that waves don't overlap (but may touch) and are given in the order they occur, i. e. ri\xe2\x89\xa4li+1ri\xe2\x89\xa4li+1."
b'Output'
b'If there is no way to clear all waves, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921. Otherwise, print the minimum possible number of bullets you need to spend (both used and thrown) to clear all waves.'
