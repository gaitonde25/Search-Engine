b'There are nn candles on a Hanukkah menorah, and some of its candles are initially lit. We can describe which candles are lit with a binary string ss, where the ii-th candle is lit if and only if si=1si=1.'
b'  '
b'Initially, the candle lights are described by a string aa. In an operation, you select a candle that is currently lit. By doing so, the candle you selected will remain lit, and every other candle will change (if it was lit, it will become unlit and if it was unlit, it will become lit).'
b'You would like to make the candles look the same as string bb. Your task is to determine if it is possible, and if it is, find the minimum number of operations required.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of candles.'
b'The second line contains a string aa of length nn consisting of symbols 0 and 1\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the initial pattern of lights.'
b'The third line contains a string bb of length nn consisting of symbols 0 and 1\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the desired pattern of lights.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to transform aa to bb, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it's impossible."
