b'You are given two integers bb and ww. You have a chessboard of size 109\xc3\x97109109\xc3\x97109 with the top left cell at (1;1)(1;1), the cell (1;1)(1;1) is painted white.'
b'Your task is to find a connected component on this chessboard that contains exactly bb black cells and exactly ww white cells. Two cells are called connected if they share a side (i.e. for the cell (x,y)(x,y) there are at most four connected cells: (x\xe2\x88\x921,y),(x+1,y),(x,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x,y+1)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y),(x+1,y),(x,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x,y+1)). A set of cells is called a connected component if for every pair of cells C1C1 and C2C2 from this set, there exists a sequence of cells c1c1, c2c2, ..., ckck such that c1=C1c1=C1, ck=C2ck=C2, all cici from 11 to kk are belong to this set of cells and for every i\xe2\x88\x88[1,k\xe2\x88\x921]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,k\xe2\x88\x921], cells cici and ci+1ci+1 are connected.'
b'Obviously, it can be impossible to find such component. In this case print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES" and any suitable connected component.'
b'You have to answer qq independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries. Then qq queries follow.'
b'The only line of the query contains two integers bb and ww (1\xe2\x89\xa4b,w\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4b,w\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of black cells required and the number of white cells required.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of numbers of cells does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105 (\xe2\x88\x91w+\xe2\x88\x91b\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\xe2\x88\x91w+\xe2\x88\x91b\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105).'
b'Output'
b'For each query, print the answer to it.'
b'If it is impossible to find the required component, print "NO" on the first line.'
b'Otherwise, print "YES" on the first line. In the next b+wb+w lines print coordinates of cells of your component in any order. There should be exactly bb black cells and ww white cells in your answer. The printed component should be connected.'
b'If there are several answers, you can print any. All coordinates in the answer should be in the range [1;109][1;109].'
