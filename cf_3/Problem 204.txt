b'Madoka finally found the administrator password for her computer. Her father is a well-known popularizer of mathematics, so the password is the answer to the following problem.'
b'Find the maximum decimal number without zeroes and with no equal digits in a row, such that the sum of its digits is nn.'
b'Madoka is too tired of math to solve it herself, so help her to solve this problem!'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The only line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the required sum of the digits.'
