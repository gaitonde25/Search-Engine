b'In Byteland, there are two political parties fighting for seats in the Parliament in the upcoming elections: Wrong Answer Party and Time Limit Exceeded Party. As they want to convince as many citizens as possible to cast their votes on them, they keep promising lower and lower taxes.'
b"There are nn cities in Byteland, connected by mm one-way roads. Interestingly enough, the road network has no cycles \xe2\x80\x94 it's impossible to start in any city, follow a number of roads, and return to that city. Last year, citizens of the ii-th city had to pay hihi bourles of tax."
b'Parties will now alternately hold the election conventions in various cities. If a party holds a convention in city vv, the party needs to decrease the taxes in this city to a non-negative integer amount of bourles. However, at the same time they can arbitrarily modify the taxes in each of the cities that can be reached from vv using a single road. The only condition that must be fulfilled that the tax in each city has to remain a non-negative integer amount of bourles.'
b"The first party to hold the convention is Wrong Answer Party. It's predicted that the party to hold the last convention will win the election. Can Wrong Answer Party win regardless of Time Limit Exceeded Party's moves?"
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn, mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000, 0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42000000\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4200000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities and roads in Byteland.'
b'The next line contains nn space-separated integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hnh1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hn (0\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109); hihi denotes the amount of taxes paid in the ii-th city.'
b'Each of the following mm lines contains two integers (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n, u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v), and describes a one-way road leading from the city uu to the city vv. There will be no cycles in the road network. No two roads will connect the same pair of cities.'
b'We can show that the conventions cannot be held indefinitely for any correct test case.'
b'Output'
b"If Wrong Answer Party can win the election, output WIN in the first line of your output. In this case, you're additionally asked to produce any convention allowing the party to win regardless of the opponent's actions. The second line should contain nn non-negative integers h\xe2\x80\xb21,h\xe2\x80\xb22,\xe2\x80\xa6,h\xe2\x80\xb2nh1\xe2\x80\xb2,h2\xe2\x80\xb2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hn\xe2\x80\xb2 (0\xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x80\xb2i\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x8510180\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851018) describing the amount of taxes paid in consecutive cities after the convention. If there are multiple answers, output any. We guarantee that if the party has any winning move, there exists a move after which no city has to pay more than 2\xe2\x8b\x8510182\xe2\x8b\x851018 bourles."
b'If the party cannot assure their victory, output LOSE in the first and only line of the output.'
