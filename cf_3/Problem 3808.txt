b"There are times you recall a good old friend and everything you've come through together. Luckily there are social networks\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 they store all your message history making it easy to know what you argued over 10 years ago."
b'More formal, your message history is a sequence of messages ordered by time sent numbered from 1 to n where n is the total number of messages in the chat.'
b'Each message might contain a link to an earlier message which it is a reply to. When opening a message x or getting a link to it, the dialogue is shown in such a way that k previous messages, message x and k next messages are visible (with respect to message x). In case there are less than k messages somewhere, they are yet all shown.'
b'Digging deep into your message history, you always read all visible messages and then go by the link in the current message x (if there is one) and continue reading in the same manner.'
b"Determine the number of messages you'll read if your start from message number t for all t from 1 to n. Calculate these numbers independently. If you start with message x, the initial configuration is x itself, k previous and k next messages. Messages read multiple times are considered as one."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n and k (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n) \xe2\x80\x94 the total amount of messages and the number of previous and next messages visible.'
b"The second line features a sequence of integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89i), where ai denotes the i-th message link destination or zero, if there's no link from i. All messages are listed in chronological order. It's guaranteed that the link from message x goes to message with number strictly less than x."
b'Output'
b'Print n integers with i-th denoting the number of distinct messages you can read starting from message i and traversing the links while possible.'
