b'You are given nn segments on the OxOx axis. The ii-th segment is given as a pair li,rili,ri, where lili is the position of the left end of the ii-th segment and riri is the position of the right end of the ii-th segment. Segments may intersect, overlap, or even coincide. A segment is a set of numbers (including floating-point numbers) lying between the segment ends or coinciding with them. Formally, the segment [l,r]={x\xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0x\xe2\x88\x88R,\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4r}[l,r]={x\xc2\xa0|\xc2\xa0x\xe2\x88\x88R,\xc2\xa0l\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4r}.'
b"Let the union of segments be the set of all axis points covered by the set of segments. Let's call a subset of the given segments good if its union equals the union of all nn segments."
b'Your task is to calculate the number of good subsets of the given nn segments. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of segments.'
b'The next nn lines contain segments. The ii-th segment is given as a pair li,rili,ri (1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4109), where lili is the left border of the segment and riri is the right border of the segment. Segments may intersect, overlap, or even coincide.'
b'Output'
b'Print the number of good subsets of the given set of segments. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 998244353998244353.'
