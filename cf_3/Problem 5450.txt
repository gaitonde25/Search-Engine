b'The developers of Looksery have to write an efficient algorithm that detects faces on a picture. Unfortunately, they are currently busy preparing a contest for you, so you will have to do it for them. '
b'In this problem an image is a rectangular table that consists of lowercase Latin letters. A face on the image is a 2\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x892 square, such that from the four letters of this square you can make word "face". '
b'You need to write a program that determines the number of faces on the image. The squares that correspond to the faces can overlap.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two space-separated integers, n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8950) \xe2\x80\x94 the height and the width of the image, respectively.'
b'Next n lines define the image. Each line contains m lowercase Latin letters.'
b'Output'
b'In the single line print the number of faces on the image.'
