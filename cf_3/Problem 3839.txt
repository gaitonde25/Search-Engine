b'Imp is really pleased that you helped him. But it you solve the last problem, his gladness would raise even more.'
b'  '
b" Let's define "
b''
b' for some set of integers '
b''
b' as the number of pairs '
b'a'
b', '
b'b'
b' in '
b''
b', such that:'
b'  a is strictly less than b;  a divides b without a remainder. '
b'You are to find such a set , which is a subset of {1,\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89n} (the set that contains all positive integers not greater than n), that . '
b'Input'
b'The only line contains two integers n and k .'
b'Output'
b'If there is no answer, print "No".'
b'Otherwise, in the first line print "Yes", in the second\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 an integer m that denotes the size of the set  you have found, in the second line print m integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the set , in any order.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
