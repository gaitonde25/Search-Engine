b'Polycarp likes to play with numbers. He takes some integer number xx, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 operations of the two kinds: '
b'  divide the number xx by 33 (xx must be divisible by 33);  multiply the number xx by 22. '
b'After each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces xx by the result. So there will be nn numbers on the board after all.'
b'You are given a sequence of length nn \xe2\x80\x94 the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.'
b"Your problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of previous number."
b'It is guaranteed that the answer exists.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contatins an integer number nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the elements in the sequence. The second line of the input contains nn integer numbers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x8510181\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851018) \xe2\x80\x94 rearranged (reordered) sequence that Polycarp can wrote down on the board.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn integer numbers \xe2\x80\x94 rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Polycarp could write down on the board.'
b'It is guaranteed that the answer exists.'
