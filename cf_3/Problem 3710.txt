b"You're given a tree with n vertices rooted at 1."
b"We say that there's a k-ary heap of depth m located at u if the following holds:"
b'  For m\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891 u itself is a k-ary heap of depth 1.  For m\xe2\x80\x89>\xe2\x80\x891 vertex u is a k-ary heap of depth m if at least k of its children are k-ary heaps of depth at least m\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891. '
b'Denote dpk(u) as maximum depth of k-ary heap in the subtree of u (including u). Your goal is to compute .'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer n denoting the size of the tree (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893\xc2\xb7105). '
b'The next n\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 lines contain two integers u, v each, describing vertices connected by i-th edge.'
b"It's guaranteed that the given configuration forms a tree."
b'Output'
b'Output the answer to the task.'
