b'This is an interactive problem.'
b"Natasha is going to fly to Mars. Finally, Natasha sat in the rocket. She flies, flies... but gets bored. She wishes to arrive to Mars already! So she decides to find something to occupy herself. She couldn't think of anything better to do than to calculate the distance to the red planet."
b"Let's define xx as the distance to Mars. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know xx. But it is known that 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4m, where Natasha knows the number mm. Besides, xx and mm are positive integers."
b'Natasha can ask the rocket questions. Every question is an integer yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4m). The correct answer to the question is \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921, if x<yx<y, 00, if x=yx=y, and 11, if x>yx>y. But the rocket is broken\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 it does not always answer correctly. Precisely: let the correct answer to the current question be equal to tt, then, if the rocket answers this question correctly, then it will answer tt, otherwise it will answer \xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x88\x92t.'
b"In addition, the rocket has a sequence pp of length nn. Each element of the sequence is either 00 or 11. The rocket processes this sequence in the cyclic order, that is 11-st element, 22-nd, 33-rd, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, (n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x921)-th, nn-th, 11-st, 22-nd, 33-rd, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, (n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x921)-th, nn-th, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6. If the current element is 11, the rocket answers correctly, if 00\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 lies. Natasha doesn't know the sequence pp, but she knows its length\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 nn."
b'You can ask the rocket no more than 6060 questions.'
b'Help Natasha find the distance to Mars. Assume, that the distance to Mars does not change while Natasha is asking questions.'
b"Your solution will not be accepted, if it does not receive an answer 00 from the rocket (even if the distance to Mars is uniquely determined by the already received rocket's answers)."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers mm and nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4109, 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4301\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa430)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum distance to Mars and the number of elements in the sequence pp.'
