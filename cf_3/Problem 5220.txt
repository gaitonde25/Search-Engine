b'Genos has been given n distinct lines on the Cartesian plane. Let  be a list of intersection points of these lines. A single point might appear multiple times in this list if it is the intersection of multiple pairs of lines. The order of the list does not matter.'
b'Given a query point (p,\xe2\x80\x89q), let  be the corresponding list of distances of all points in  to the query point. Distance here refers to euclidean distance. As a refresher, the euclidean distance between two points (x1,\xe2\x80\x89y1) and (x2,\xe2\x80\x89y2) is .'
b'Genos is given a point (p,\xe2\x80\x89q) and a positive integer m. He is asked to find the sum of the m smallest elements in . Duplicate elements in  are treated as separate elements. Genos is intimidated by Div1 E problems so he asked for your help.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8950\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of lines.'
b'The second line contains three integers x, y and m (|x|,\xe2\x80\x89|y|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x89000, )\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the encoded coordinates of the query point and the integer m from the statement above. The query point (p,\xe2\x80\x89q) is obtained as . In other words, divide x and y by 1000 to get the actual query point.  denotes the length of the list  and it is guaranteed that .'
b'Each of the next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (|ai|,\xe2\x80\x89|bi|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x89000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the parameters for a line of the form: . It is guaranteed that no two lines are the same, that is (ai,\xe2\x80\x89bi)\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89(aj,\xe2\x80\x89bj) if i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89j.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single real number, the sum of m smallest elements of . Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x896.'
b"To clarify, let's assume that your answer is a and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if ."
