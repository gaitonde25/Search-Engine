Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.'
b'Help Ivan to calculate this number x!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a,\xe2\x80\x89b\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100, 2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89b) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.'
