b"Phoenix has nn blocks of height h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hnh1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hn, and all hihi don't exceed some value xx. He plans to stack all nn blocks into mm separate towers. The height of a tower is simply the sum of the heights of its blocks. For the towers to look beautiful, no two towers may have a height difference of strictly more than xx. "
b'Please help Phoenix build mm towers that look beautiful. Each tower must have at least one block and all blocks must be used.'
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains three integers nn, mm, and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105; 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of blocks, the number of towers to build, and the maximum acceptable height difference of any two towers, respectively. '
b'The second line of each test case contains nn space-separated integers (1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4x)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the heights of the blocks. '
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all the test cases will not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, if Phoenix cannot build mm towers that look beautiful, print NO. Otherwise, print YES, followed by nn integers y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yny1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yn, where yiyi (1\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4yi\xe2\x89\xa4m) is the index of the tower that the ii-th block is placed in.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.'
