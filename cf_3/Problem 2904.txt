b'Niyaz has a tree with nn vertices numerated from 11 to nn. A tree is a connected graph without cycles.'
b'Each edge in this tree has strictly positive integer weight. A degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to this vertex.'
b'Niyaz does not like when vertices in the tree have too large degrees. For each xx from 00 to (n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x921), he wants to find the smallest total weight of a set of edges to be deleted so that degrees of all vertices become at most xx.'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42500002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4250000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in Niyaz's tree."
b'Each of the next (n\xe2\x88\x921)(n\xe2\x88\x921) lines contains three integers aa, bb, cc (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the indices of the vertices connected by this edge and its weight, respectively. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print nn integers: for each x=0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,(n\xe2\x88\x921)x=0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,(n\xe2\x88\x921) print the smallest total weight of such a set of edges that after one deletes the edges from the set, the degrees of all vertices become less than or equal to xx.'
