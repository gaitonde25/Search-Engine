b'Dora the explorer has decided to use her money after several years of juicy royalties to go shopping. What better place to shop than Nlogonia?'
b'There are nn stores numbered from 11 to nn in Nlogonia. The ii-th of these stores offers a positive integer aiai.'
b'Each day among the last mm days Dora bought a single integer from some of the stores. The same day, Swiper the fox bought a single integer from all the stores that Dora did not buy an integer from on that day.'
b'Dora considers Swiper to be her rival, and she considers that she beat Swiper on day ii if and only if the least common multiple of the numbers she bought on day ii is strictly greater than the least common multiple of the numbers that Swiper bought on day ii.'
b'The least common multiple (LCM) of a collection of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the integers in the collection.'
b"However, Dora forgot the values of aiai. Help Dora find out if there are positive integer values of aiai such that she beat Swiper on every day. You don't need to find what are the possible values of aiai though."
b'Note that it is possible for some values of aiai to coincide in a solution.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integers mm and nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa450, 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of days and the number of stores.'
b'After this mm lines follow, the ii-th line starts with an integer sisi (1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x9211\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921), the number of integers Dora bought on day ii, followed by sisi distinct integers, the indices of the stores where Dora bought an integer on the ii-th day. The indices are between 11 and nn.'
b'Output'
b'Output must consist of a single line containing "possible" if there exist positive integers aiai such that for each day the least common multiple of the integers bought by Dora is strictly greater than the least common multiple of the integers bought by Swiper on that day. Otherwise, print "impossible".'
b"Note that you don't have to restore the integers themselves."
