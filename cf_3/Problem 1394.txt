b'  "You must lift the dam. With a lever. I will give it to you.You must block the canal. With a rock. I will not give the rock to you." '
b'Danik urgently needs rock and lever! Obviously, the easiest way to get these things is to ask Hermit Lizard for them.'
b'Hermit Lizard agreed to give Danik the lever. But to get a stone, Danik needs to solve the following task.'
b'You are given a positive integer nn, and an array aa of positive integers. The task is to calculate the number of such pairs (i,j)(i,j) that i<ji<j and aiai && aj\xe2\x89\xa5ai\xe2\x8a\x95ajaj\xe2\x89\xa5ai\xe2\x8a\x95aj, where && denotes the bitwise AND operation, and \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.'
b'Danik has solved this task. But can you solve it?'
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases.'
b'The first line contains one positive integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains one positive integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 length of the array.'
b'The second line contains nn positive integers aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 elements of the array.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For every test case print one non-negative integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the problem.'
