b'Let FkFk denote the kk-th term of Fibonacci sequence, defined as below:'
b' F0=F1=1F0=F1=1 for any integer n\xe2\x89\xa50n\xe2\x89\xa50, Fn+2=Fn+1+FnFn+2=Fn+1+Fn'
b'You are given a tree with nn vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.'
b'We call a tree a Fib-tree, if its number of vertices equals FkFk for some kk, and at least one of the following conditions holds:'
b' The tree consists of only 11 vertex; You can divide it into two Fib-trees by removing some edge of the tree. '
b'Determine whether the given tree is a Fib-tree or not.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree.'
b"Then n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow, each of which contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n, u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v), representing an edge between vertices uu and vv. It's guaranteed that given edges form a tree."
b'Output'
b'Print "YES" if the given tree is a Fib-tree, or "NO" otherwise.'
b'You can print your answer in any case. For example, if the answer is "YES", then the output "Yes" or "yeS" will also be considered as correct answer.'
