b'Marina loves strings of the same length and Vasya loves when there is a third string, different from them in exactly t characters. Help Vasya find at least one such string.'
b"More formally, you are given two strings s1, s2 of length n and number t. Let's denote as f(a,\xe2\x80\x89b) the number of characters in which strings a and b are different. Then your task will be to find any string s3 of length n, such that f(s1,\xe2\x80\x89s3)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89f(s2,\xe2\x80\x89s3)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89t. If there is no such string, print \xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers n and t (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89105, 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89t\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n).'
b'The second line contains string s1 of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.'
b'The third line contain string s2 of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.'
b'Output'
b"Print a string of length n, differing from string s1 and from s2 in exactly t characters. Your string should consist only from lowercase English letters. If such string doesn't exist, print -1."
