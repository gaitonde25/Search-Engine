b'You are given a sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an consisting of nn integers.'
b'You may perform the following operation on this sequence: choose any element and either increase or decrease it by one.'
b'Calculate the minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, if you can perform the aforementioned operation no more than kk times.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41014)(2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41014) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of elements in the sequence and the maximum number of times you can perform the operation, respectively.'
b'The second line contains a sequence of integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)(1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109).'
b'Output'
b'Print the minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, if you can perform the aforementioned operation no more than kk times.'
