b'This is the hard version of the problem. The difference is the constraints on nn, mm and tt. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.'
b'Alice and Bob are given the numbers nn, mm and kk, and play a game as follows:'
b'The game has a score that Alice tries to maximize, and Bob tries to minimize. The score is initially 00. The game consists of nn turns. Each turn, Alice picks a real number from 00 to kk (inclusive) which Bob either adds to or subtracts from the score of the game. But throughout the game, Bob has to choose to add at least mm out of the nn turns.'
b'Bob gets to know which number Alice picked before deciding whether to add or subtract the number from the score, and Alice gets to know whether Bob added or subtracted the number for the previous turn before picking the number for the current turn (except on the first turn since there was no previous turn).'
b'If Alice and Bob play optimally, what will the final score of the game be?'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.'
b'Each test case consists of a single line containing the three integers, nn, mm, and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106,0\xe2\x89\xa4k<109+71\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106,0\xe2\x89\xa4k<109+7) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of turns, how many of those turns Bob has to add, and the biggest number Alice can choose, respectively.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 106106.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output a single integer number \xe2\x80\x94 the score of the optimal game modulo 109+7109+7.'
b'Formally, let M=109+7M=109+7. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction pqpq, where pp and qq are integers and q\xe2\x89\xa1\xcc\xb80(modM)q\xe2\x89\xa20(modM). Output the integer equal to p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921modMp\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921modM. In other words, output such an integer xx that 0\xe2\x89\xa4x<M0\xe2\x89\xa4x<M and x\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x89\xa1p(modM)x\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x89\xa1p(modM).'
