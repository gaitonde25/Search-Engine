b'You are given four different integer points p1p1, p2p2, p3p3 and p4p4 on XYXY grid.'
b'In one step you can choose one of the points pipi and move it in one of four directions by one. In other words, if you have chosen point pi=(x,y)pi=(x,y) you can move it to (x,y+1)(x,y+1), (x,y\xe2\x88\x921)(x,y\xe2\x88\x921), (x+1,y)(x+1,y) or (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y).'
b'Your goal to move points in such a way that they will form a square with sides parallel to OXOX and OYOY axes (a square with side 00 is allowed).'
b'What is the minimum number of steps you need to make such a square?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case consists of four lines. Each line contains two integers xx and yy (0\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 coordinates of one of the points pi=(x,y)pi=(x,y).'
b'All points are different in one test case.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of steps to make a square.'
