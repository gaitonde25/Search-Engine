b'Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is struggling with his homework \xe2\x80\x93 a number division problem.'
b"There are nn positive integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an on Bob's homework paper, where nn is always an even number. Bob is asked to divide those numbers into groups, where each group must contain at least 22 numbers. Suppose the numbers are divided into mm groups, and the sum of the numbers in the jj-th group is sjsj. Bob's aim is to minimize the sum of the square of sjsj, that is \xe2\x88\x91j=1ms2j.\xe2\x88\x91j=1msj2."
b'Bob is puzzled by this hard problem. Could you please help him solve it?'
b'Input'
b"The first line contains an even integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105), denoting that there are nn integers on Bob's homework paper."
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4104), describing the numbers you need to deal with.'
b'Output'
b'A single line containing one integer, denoting the minimum of the sum of the square of sjsj, which is \xe2\x88\x91i=jms2j,\xe2\x88\x91i=jmsj2, where mm is the number of groups.'
