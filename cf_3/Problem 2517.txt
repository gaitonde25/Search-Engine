b"While sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly HH centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of LL centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface."
b'  '
b'Suppose that the lily grows at some point AA on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point AA. Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point AA, i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point AA?'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains two integers HH and LL (1\xe2\x89\xa4H<L\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4H<L\xe2\x89\xa4106).'
b'Output'
b'Print a single number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the depth of the lake at point AA. The absolute or relative error should not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610\xe2\x88\x926.'
b"Formally, let your answer be AA, and the jury's answer be BB. Your answer is accepted if and only if |A\xe2\x88\x92B|max(1,|B|)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926|A\xe2\x88\x92B|max(1,|B|)\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926."
