b'You are given a set of nn points in a 2D plane. No three points are collinear.'
b"A pentagram is a set of 55 points A,B,C,D,EA,B,C,D,E that can be arranged as follows.  Note the length of the line segments don't matter, only that those particular intersections exist."
b'Count the number of ways to choose 55 points from the given set that form a pentagram.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer nn (5\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43005\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4300)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains two integers xi,yixi,yi (\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4106\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the ii-th point. It is guaranteed that no three points are collinear.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer, the number of sets of 55 points that form a pentagram.'
