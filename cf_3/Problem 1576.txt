b'In the game of Mastermind, there are two players \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Alice and Bob. Alice has a secret code, which Bob tries to guess. Here, a code is defined as a sequence of nn colors. There are exactly n+1n+1 colors in the entire universe, numbered from 11 to n+1n+1 inclusive.'
b'When Bob guesses a code, Alice tells him some information about how good of a guess it is, in the form of two integers xx and yy.'
b"The first integer xx is the number of indices where Bob's guess correctly matches Alice's code. The second integer yy is the size of the intersection of the two codes as multisets. That is, if Bob were to change the order of the colors in his guess, yy is the maximum number of indices he could get correct."
b"For example, suppose n=5n=5, Alice's code is [3,1,6,1,2][3,1,6,1,2], and Bob's guess is [3,1,1,2,5][3,1,1,2,5]. At indices 11 and 22 colors are equal, while in the other indices they are not equal. So x=2x=2. And the two codes have the four colors 1,1,2,31,1,2,3 in common, so y=4y=4."
b'  Solid lines denote a matched color for the same index. Dashed lines denote a matched color at a different index. xx is the number of solid lines, and yy is the total number of lines. '
b"You are given Bob's guess and two values xx and yy. Can you find one possibility of Alice's code so that the values of xx and yy are correct?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Next 2t2t lines contain descriptions of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains three integers n,x,yn,x,y (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105,0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the codes, and two values Alice responds with.'
b"The second line of each test case contains nn integers b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n+11\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4n+1) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Bob's guess, where bibi is the ii-th color of the guess."
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn across all test cases does not exceed 105105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, on the first line, output "YES" if there is a solution, or "NO" if there is no possible secret code consistent with the described situation. You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).'
b'If the answer is "YES", on the next line output nn integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n+11\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n+1) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Alice\'s secret code, where aiai is the ii-th color of the code.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, output any.'
