b'Polycarp plays a computer game. In this game, the players summon armies of magical minions, which then fight each other.'
b"Polycarp can summon nn different minions. The initial power level of the ii-th minion is aiai, and when it is summoned, all previously summoned minions' power levels are increased by bibi. The minions can be summoned in any order."
b'Unfortunately, Polycarp cannot have more than kk minions under his control. To get rid of unwanted minions after summoning them, he may destroy them. Each minion can be summoned (and destroyed) only once.'
b"Polycarp's goal is to summon the strongest possible army. Formally, he wants to maximize the sum of power levels of all minions under his control (those which are summoned and not destroyed)."
b'Help Polycarp to make up a plan of actions to summon the strongest possible army!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4751\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa475) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each test case begins with a line containing two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4751\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa475) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of minions availible for summoning, and the maximum number of minions that can be controlled by Polycarp, respectively.'
b'Then nn lines follow, the ii-th line contains 22 integers aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105, 0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41050\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the parameters of the ii-th minion.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print the optimal sequence of actions as follows:'
b"Firstly, print mm \xe2\x80\x94 the number of actions which Polycarp has to perform (0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42n0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42n). Then print mm integers o1o1, o2o2, ..., omom, where oioi denotes the ii-th action as follows: if the ii-th action is to summon the minion xx, then oi=xoi=x, and if the ii-th action is to destroy the minion xx, then oi=\xe2\x88\x92xoi=\xe2\x88\x92x. Each minion can be summoned at most once and cannot be destroyed before being summoned (and, obviously, cannot be destroyed more than once). The number of minions in Polycarp's army should be not greater than kk after every action."
b'If there are multiple optimal sequences, print any of them.'
