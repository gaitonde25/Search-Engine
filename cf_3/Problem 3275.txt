b'Formula 1 officials decided to introduce new competition. Cars are replaced by space ships and number of points awarded can differ per race.'
b"Given the current ranking in the competition and points distribution for the next race, your task is to calculate the best possible ranking for a given astronaut after the next race. It's guaranteed that given astronaut will have unique number of points before the race."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integer numbers NN (1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200000) representing number of F1 astronauts, and current position of astronaut DD (1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4N) you want to calculate best ranking for (no other competitor will have the same number of points before the race).'
b'The second line contains NN integer numbers SkSk (0\xe2\x89\xa4Sk\xe2\x89\xa41080\xe2\x89\xa4Sk\xe2\x89\xa4108, k=1...Nk=1...N), separated by a single space, representing current ranking of astronauts. Points are sorted in non-increasing order.'
b'The third line contains NN integer numbers PkPk (0\xe2\x89\xa4Pk\xe2\x89\xa41080\xe2\x89\xa4Pk\xe2\x89\xa4108, k=1...Nk=1...N), separated by a single space, representing point awards for the next race. Points are sorted in non-increasing order, so winner of the race gets the maximum number of points.'
b'Output'
b'Output contains one integer number \xe2\x80\x94 the best possible ranking for astronaut after the race. If multiple astronauts have the same score after the race, they all share the best ranking.'
