b"Ani and Borna are playing a short game on a two-variable polynomial. It's a special kind of a polynomial: the monomials are fixed, but all of its coefficients are fill-in-the-blanks dashes, e.g. _xy+_x4y7+_x8y3+\xe2\x80\xa6_xy+_x4y7+_x8y3+\xe2\x80\xa6"
b'Borna will fill in the blanks with positive integers. He wants the polynomial to be bounded from below, i.e. his goal is to make sure there exists a real number MM such that the value of the polynomial at any point is greater than MM. '
b" Ani is mischievous, and wants the polynomial to be unbounded. Along with stealing Borna's heart, she can also steal parts of polynomials. Ani is only a petty kind of thief, though: she can only steal at most one monomial from the polynomial before Borna fills in the blanks. "
b'If Ani and Borna play their only moves optimally, who wins?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a positive integer NN (2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200000)(2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200000), denoting the number of the terms in the starting special polynomial.'
b'Each of the following NN lines contains a description of a monomial: the kk-th line contains two **space**-separated integers akak and bkbk (0\xe2\x89\xa4ak,bk\xe2\x89\xa4109(0\xe2\x89\xa4ak,bk\xe2\x89\xa4109) which mean the starting polynomial has the term _xakybk_xakybk. It is guaranteed that for k\xe2\x89\xa0lk\xe2\x89\xa0l, either ak\xe2\x89\xa0alak\xe2\x89\xa0al or bk\xe2\x89\xa0blbk\xe2\x89\xa0bl.'
b'Output'
b'If Borna can always choose the coefficients such that the resulting polynomial is bounded from below, regardless of what monomial Ani steals, output "Borna". Else, output "Ani". '
b"You shouldn't output the quotation marks."
