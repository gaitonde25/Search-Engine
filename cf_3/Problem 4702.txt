b'This is an interactive problem. You have to use flush operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use function fflush(stdout), in Java \xe2\x80\x94 System.out.flush(), in Pascal \xe2\x80\x94 flush(output) and in Python \xe2\x80\x94 sys.stdout.flush().'
b'In this problem, you need to find maximal and minimal elements of an array. What could be simpler?'
b"You can imagine that the jury has an array, and initially you know the only number n \xe2\x80\x94 array's length."
b"Array's elements are numbered from 1 to n. You are allowed to compare two elements of the array by using their indices i and j. There are three possible responses to this query: '<' (if ai is less than aj), '=' (if ai is equal to aj) and finally '>' (if ai is greater than aj)."
b"It's known that it's always possible to find both maximal and minimal elements of the array by using no more than  comparisons, where \xe2\x8c\x88 x\xe2\x8c\x89 is the result of rounding x up."
b"Write the program that will find positions of the minimum and the maximum in the jury's array of length n, by using no more than f(n) comparisons."
