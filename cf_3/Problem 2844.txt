b'There are mm people living in a city. There are nn dishes sold in the city. Each dish ii has a price pipi, a standard sisi and a beauty bibi. Each person jj has an income of incjincj and a preferred beauty prefjprefj. '
b"A person would never buy a dish whose standard is less than the person's income. Also, a person can't afford a dish with a price greater than the income of the person. In other words, a person jj can buy a dish ii only if pi\xe2\x89\xa4incj\xe2\x89\xa4sipi\xe2\x89\xa4incj\xe2\x89\xa4si."
b"Also, a person jj can buy a dish ii, only if |bi\xe2\x88\x92prefj|\xe2\x89\xa4(incj\xe2\x88\x92pi)|bi\xe2\x88\x92prefj|\xe2\x89\xa4(incj\xe2\x88\x92pi). In other words, if the price of the dish is less than the person's income by kk, the person will only allow the absolute difference of at most kk between the beauty of the dish and his/her preferred beauty.
