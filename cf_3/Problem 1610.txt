b'You are given a chessboard consisting of nn rows and nn columns. Rows are numbered from bottom to top from 11 to nn. Columns are numbered from left to right from 11 to nn. The cell at the intersection of the xx-th column and the yy-th row is denoted as (x,y)(x,y). Furthermore, the kk-th column is a special column. '
b'Initially, the board is empty. There are mm changes to the board. During the ii-th change one pawn is added or removed from the board. The current board is good if we can move all pawns to the special column by the followings rules:'
b'  Pawn in the cell (x,y)(x,y) can be moved to the cell (x,y+1)(x,y+1), (x\xe2\x88\x921,y+1)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y+1) or (x+1,y+1)(x+1,y+1);  You can make as many such moves as you like;  Pawns can not be moved outside the chessboard;  Each cell can not contain more than one pawn. '
b'The current board may not always be good. To fix it, you can add new rows to the board. New rows are added at the top, i.\xe2\x80\x89e. they will have numbers n+1,n+2,n+3,\xe2\x80\xa6n+1,n+2,n+3,\xe2\x80\xa6.'
b'After each of mm changes, print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of rows which you have to add to make the board good.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, kk and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105;1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105;1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the board, the index of the special column and the number of changes respectively.'
b'Then mm lines follow. The ii-th line contains two integers xx and yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the index of the column and the index of the row respectively. If there is no pawn in the cell (x,y)(x,y), then you add a pawn to this cell, otherwise \xe2\x80\x94 you remove the pawn from this cell.'
b'Output'
b'After each change print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of rows which you have to add to make the board good.'
