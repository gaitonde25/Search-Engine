b'You are given an acyclic directed graph, consisting of nn vertices and mm edges. The graph contains no multiple edges and no self-loops.'
b'The vertex is called a source if it has no incoming edges. The vertex is called a sink if it has no outgoing edges. These definitions imply that some vertices can be both source and sink.'
b"The number of sources in the given graph is equal to the number of sinks in it, and each of these numbers doesn't exceed 2020."
b'The following algorithm is applied to the graph:'
b'  if the graph has no sources and sinks then quit;  choose arbitrary source ss, arbitrary sink tt, add an edge from tt to ss to the graph and go to step 11 (that operation pops ss out of sources and tt out of sinks). Note that ss and tt may be the same vertex, then a self-loop is added. '
b'At the end you check if the graph becomes strongly connected (that is, any vertex is reachable from any other vertex).'
b'Your task is to check that the graph becomes strongly connected no matter the choice of sources and sinks on the second step of the algorithm.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4106) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph, respectively.'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two integers vi,uivi,ui (1\xe2\x89\xa4vi,ui\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi,ui\xe2\x89\xa4n, vi\xe2\x89\xa0uivi\xe2\x89\xa0ui) \xe2\x80\x94 the description of the ii-th edge of the original graph.'
b"It is guaranteed that the number of sources and the number of sinks in the graph are the same and they don't exceed 2020. It is guaranteed that the given graph contains no multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the graph contains no cycles."
b'Output'
b'Print "YES" if the graph becomes strongly connected no matter the choice of sources and sinks on the second step of the algorithm. Otherwise print "NO".'
