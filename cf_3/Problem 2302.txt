b'Ujan has a lot of numbers in his boxes. He likes order and balance, so he decided to reorder the numbers.'
b'There are kk boxes numbered from 11 to kk. The ii-th box contains nini integer numbers. The integers can be negative. All of the integers are distinct. '
b'Ujan is lazy, so he will do the following reordering of the numbers exactly once. He will pick a single integer from each of the boxes, kk integers in total. Then he will insert the chosen numbers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 one integer in each of the boxes, so that the number of integers in each box is the same as in the beginning. Note that he may also insert an integer he picked from a box back into the same box.'
b'Ujan will be happy if the sum of the integers in each box is the same. Can he achieve this and make the boxes perfectly balanced, like all things should be?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4151\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa415), the number of boxes. '
b'The ii-th of the next kk lines first contains a single integer nini (1\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa450001\xe2\x89\xa4ni\xe2\x89\xa45000), the number of integers in box ii. Then the same line contains nini integers ai,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,niai,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,ni (|ai,j|\xe2\x89\xa4109|ai,j|\xe2\x89\xa4109), the integers in the ii-th box. '
b'It is guaranteed that all ai,jai,j are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'If Ujan cannot achieve his goal, output "No" in a single line. Otherwise in the first line output "Yes", and then output kk lines. The ii-th of these lines should contain two integers cici and pipi. This means that Ujan should pick the integer cici from the ii-th box and place it in the pipi-th box afterwards.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, output any of those.'
b'You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
