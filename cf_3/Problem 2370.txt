b'You are given a weighted tree consisting of nn vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected graph without cycles. Vertices uiui and vivi are connected by an edge with weight wiwi.'
b"Let's define the kk-coloring of the tree as an assignment of exactly kk colors to each vertex, so that each color is used no more than two times. You can assume that you have infinitely many colors available. We say that an edge is saturated in the given kk-coloring if its endpoints share at least one color (i.e. there exists a color that is assigned to both endpoints)."
b"Let's also define the value of a kk-coloring as the sum of weights of saturated edges."
b'Please calculate the maximum possible value of a kk-coloring of the given tree.'
b'You have to answer qq independent queries.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x93 the number of queries.'
b'The first line of each query contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree and the number of colors to assign to each vertex, respectively.'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge ii is denoted by three integers uiui, vivi and wiwi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi, 1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the labels of vertices it connects and the weight of the edge. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'It is guaranteed that sum of all nn over all queries does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each query print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum value of a kk-coloring of the given tree.'
