b'A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round if it is of the form d00...0. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from 11 to 99 (inclusive) are round.'
b'For example, the following numbers are round: 40004000, 11, 99, 800800, 9090. The following numbers are not round: 110110, 707707, 222222, 10011001.'
b'You are given a positive integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104). Represent the number nn as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number nn as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the input. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case is a line containing an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104).'
b'Output'
b'Print tt answers to the test cases. Each answer must begin with an integer kk \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of summands. Next, kk terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is nn. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.'
