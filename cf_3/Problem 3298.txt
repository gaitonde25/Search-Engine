b'Awruk is taking part in elections in his school. It is the final round. He has only one opponent\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 Elodreip. The are nn students in the school. Each student has exactly kk votes and is obligated to use all of them. So Awruk knows that if a person gives aiai votes for Elodreip, than he will get exactly k\xe2\x88\x92aik\xe2\x88\x92ai votes from this person. Of course 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x88\x92ai0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x88\x92ai holds.'
b'Awruk knows that if he loses his life is over. He has been speaking a lot with his friends and now he knows a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an \xe2\x80\x94 how many votes for Elodreip each student wants to give. Now he wants to change the number kk to win the elections. Of course he knows that bigger kk means bigger chance that somebody may notice that he has changed something and then he will be disqualified.'
b'So, Awruk knows a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an \xe2\x80\x94 how many votes each student will give to his opponent. Help him select the smallest winning number kk. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of students in the school.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of votes each student gives to Elodreip.'
b'Output'
