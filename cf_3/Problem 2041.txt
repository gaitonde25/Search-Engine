b'Recall that MEX of an array is a minimum non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. Examples:'
b'  for the array [0,0,1,0,2][0,0,1,0,2] MEX equals to 33 because numbers 0,10,1 and 22 are presented in the array and 33 is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array;  for the array [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4] MEX equals to 00 because 00 is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array;  for the array [0,1,4,3][0,1,4,3] MEX equals to 22 because 22 is the minimum non-negative integer not presented in the array. '
b'You are given an empty array a=[]a=[] (in other words, a zero-length array). You are also given a positive integer xx.'
b'You are also given qq queries. The jj-th query consists of one integer yjyj and means that you have to append one element yjyj to the array. The array length increases by 11 after a query.'
b'In one move, you can choose any index ii and set ai:=ai+xai:=ai+x or ai:=ai\xe2\x88\x92xai:=ai\xe2\x88\x92x (i.e. increase or decrease any element of the array by xx). The only restriction is that aiai cannot become negative. Since initially the array is empty, you can perform moves only after the first query.'
b'You have to maximize the MEX (minimum excluded) of the array if you can perform any number of such operations (you can even perform the operation multiple times with one element).'
b'You have to find the answer after each of qq queries (i.e. the jj-th answer corresponds to the array of length jj).'
b'Operations are discarded before each query. I.e. the array aa after the jj-th query equals to [y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yj][y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yj].'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers q,xq,x (1\xe2\x89\xa4q,x\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4q,x\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of queries and the value of xx.'
b'The next qq lines describe queries. The jj-th query consists of one integer yjyj (0\xe2\x89\xa4yj\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4yj\xe2\x89\xa4109) and means that you have to append one element yjyj to the array.'
b'Output'
b'Print the answer to the initial problem after each query \xe2\x80\x94 for the query jj print the maximum value of MEX after first jj queries. Note that queries are dependent (the array changes after each query) but operations are independent between queries.'
