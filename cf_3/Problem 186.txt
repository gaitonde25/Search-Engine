b'Now Dmitry has a session, and he has to pass nn exams. The session starts on day 11 and lasts dd days. The iith exam will take place on the day of aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4d1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4d), all aiai\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 are different.'
b'  Sample, where n=3n=3, d=12d=12, a=[3,5,9]a=[3,5,9]. Orange\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 exam days. Before the first exam Dmitry will rest 22 days, before the second he will rest 11 day and before the third he will rest 33 days. '
b'For the session schedule, Dmitry considers a special value \xce\xbc\xce\xbc \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest of the rest times before the exam for all exams. For example, for the image above, \xce\xbc=1\xce\xbc=1. In other words, for the schedule, he counts exactly nn numbers \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 how many days he rests between the exam i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921 and ii (for i=0i=0 between the start of the session and the exam ii). Then it finds \xce\xbc\xce\xbc\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum among these nn numbers.'
b'Dmitry believes that he can improve the schedule of the session. He may ask to change the date of one exam (change one arbitrary value of aiai). Help him change the date so that all aiai remain different, and the value of \xce\xbc\xce\xbc is as large as possible.'
b'For example, for the schedule above, it is most advantageous for Dmitry to move the second exam to the very end of the session. The new schedule will take the form:'
b'  Now the rest periods before exams are equal to [2,2,5][2,2,5]. So, \xce\xbc=2\xce\xbc=2. '
b'Dmitry can leave the proposed schedule unchanged (if there is no way to move one exam so that it will lead to an improvement in the situation).'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input data contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.'
b'An empty line is written in the test before each case.'
b'The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and dd (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105,1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of exams and the length of the session, respectively.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4d,ai<ai+11\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4d,ai<ai+1), where the ii-th number means the date of the ii-th exam.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output the maximum possible value of \xce\xbc\xce\xbc if Dmitry can move any one exam to an arbitrary day. All values of aiai should remain distinct.'
