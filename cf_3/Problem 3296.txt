b"IA has so many colorful magnets on her fridge! Exactly one letter is written on each magnet, 'a' or 'b'. She loves to play with them, placing all magnets in a row. However, the girl is quickly bored and usually thinks how to make her entertainment more interesting."
b'Today, when IA looked at the fridge, she noticed that the word formed by magnets is really messy. "It would look much better when I\'ll swap some of them!"\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 thought the girl\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 "but how to do it?". After a while, she got an idea. IA will look at all prefixes with lengths from 11 to the length of the word and for each prefix she will either reverse this prefix or leave it as it is. She will consider the prefixes in the fixed order: from the shortest to the largest. She wants to get the lexicographically smallest possible word after she considers all prefixes. Can you help her, telling which prefixes should be chosen for reversing?'
b'A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds:'
b' aa is a prefix of bb, but a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b; in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb.'
b'Input'
b"The first and the only line contains a string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa41000), describing the initial string formed by magnets. The string ss consists only of characters 'a' and 'b'."
b'Output'
b'Output exactly |s||s| integers. If IA should reverse the ii-th prefix (that is, the substring from 11 to ii), the ii-th integer should be equal to 11, and it should be equal to 00 otherwise.'
b'If there are multiple possible sequences leading to the optimal answer, print any of them.'
