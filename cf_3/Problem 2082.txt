b'Today, Mezo is playing a game. Zoma, a character in that game, is initially at position x=0x=0. Mezo starts sending nn commands to Zoma. There are two possible commands:'
b"  'L' (Left) sets the position x:=x\xe2\x88\x921x:=x\xe2\x88\x921;  'R' (Right) sets the position x:=x+1x:=x+1. "
b"Unfortunately, Mezo's controller malfunctions sometimes. Some commands are sent successfully and some are ignored. If the command is ignored then the position xx doesn't change and Mezo simply proceeds to the next command."
b'For example, if Mezo sends commands "LRLR", then here are some possible outcomes (underlined commands are sent successfully): '
b'  "LRLR" \xe2\x80\x94 Zoma moves to the left, to the right, to the left again and to the right for the final time, ending up at position 00;  "LRLR" \xe2\x80\x94 Zoma recieves no commands, doesn\'t move at all and ends up at position 00 as well;  "LRLR" \xe2\x80\x94 Zoma moves to the left, then to the left again and ends up in position \xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x88\x922. '
b"Mezo doesn't know which commands will be sent successfully beforehand. Thus, he wants to know how many different positions may Zoma end up at."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of commands Mezo sends.'
b"The second line contains a string ss of nn commands, each either 'L' (Left) or 'R' (Right)."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of different positions Zoma may end up at.'
