b'Catherine has a deck of n cards, each of which is either red, green, or blue. As long as there are at least two cards left, she can do one of two actions: '
b'  take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with different colors and exchange them for a new card of the third color;  take any two (not necessarily adjacent) cards with the same color and exchange them for a new card with that color. '
b'She repeats this process until there is only one card left. What are the possible colors for the final card?'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89200)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the total number of cards.'
b"The next line contains a string s of length n \xe2\x80\x94 the colors of the cards. s contains only the characters 'B', 'G', and 'R', representing blue, green, and red, respectively."
b'Output'
b'Print a single string of up to three characters\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the possible colors of the final card (using the same symbols as the input) in alphabetical order.'
