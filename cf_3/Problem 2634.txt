b"Serge came to the school dining room and discovered that there is a big queue here. There are mm pupils in the queue. He's not sure now if he wants to wait until the queue will clear, so he wants to know which dish he will receive if he does. As Serge is very tired, he asks you to compute it instead of him."
b'Initially there are nn dishes with costs a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an. As you already know, there are the queue of mm pupils who have b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bmb1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bm togrogs respectively (pupils are enumerated by queue order, i.e the first pupil in the queue has b1b1 togrogs and the last one has bmbm togrogs)'
b"Pupils think that the most expensive dish is the most delicious one, so every pupil just buys the most expensive dish for which he has money (every dish has a single copy, so when a pupil has bought it nobody can buy it later), and if a pupil doesn't have money for any dish, he just leaves the queue (so brutal capitalism...)"
b"But money isn't a problem at all for Serge, so Serge is buying the most expensive dish if there is at least one remaining."
b"Moreover, Serge's school has a very unstable economic situation and the costs of some dishes or number of togrogs of some pupils can change. More formally, you must process qq queries:"
b'  change aiai to xx. It means that the price of the ii-th dish becomes xx togrogs.  change bibi to xx. It means that the ii-th pupil in the queue has xx togrogs now. '
b'Nobody leaves the queue during those queries because a saleswoman is late.'
b'After every query, you must tell Serge price of the dish which he will buy if he has waited until the queue is clear, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if there are no dishes at this point, according to rules described above.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integers nn and mm (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4300\xc2\xa00001\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4300\xc2\xa0000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of dishes and pupils respectively. The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 elements of array aa. The third line contains mm integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bmb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bm (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 elements of array bb. The fourth line conatins integer qq (1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4300\xc2\xa00001\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4300\xc2\xa0000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of queries.'
b'Each of the following qq lines contains as follows: '
b'  if a query changes price of some dish, it contains 11, and two integers ii and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4106), what means aiai becomes xx.  if a query changes number of togrogs of some pupil, it contains 22, and two integers ii and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4m, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4106), what means bibi becomes xx. '
b'Output'
b'For each of qq queries prints the answer as the statement describes, the answer of the ii-th query in the ii-th line (the price of the dish which Serge will buy or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if nothing remains)'
