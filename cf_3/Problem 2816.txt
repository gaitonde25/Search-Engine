b'You are given two strings ss and tt, both consisting of exactly kk lowercase Latin letters, ss is lexicographically less than tt.'
b'Let\'s consider list of all strings consisting of exactly kk lowercase Latin letters, lexicographically not less than ss and not greater than tt (including ss and tt) in lexicographical order. For example, for k=2k=2, s=s="az" and t=t="bf" the list will be ["az", "ba", "bb", "bc", "bd", "be", "bf"].'
b'Your task is to print the median (the middle element) of this list. For the example above this will be "bc".'
b'It is guaranteed that there is an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than ss and not greater than tt.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of strings.'
b'The second line of the input contains one string ss consisting of exactly kk lowercase Latin letters.'
b'The third line of the input contains one string tt consisting of exactly kk lowercase Latin letters.'
b'It is guaranteed that ss is lexicographically less than tt.'
b'It is guaranteed that there is an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than ss and not greater than tt.'
b'Output'
b'Print one string consisting exactly of kk lowercase Latin letters \xe2\x80\x94 the median (the middle element) of list of strings of length kk lexicographically not less than ss and not greater than tt.'
