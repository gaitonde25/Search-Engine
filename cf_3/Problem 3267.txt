b'You are given a grid, consisting of 22 rows and nn columns. Each cell of this grid should be colored either black or white.'

b"Let's call some bicoloring beautiful if it has exactly kk components."
b'Count the number of beautiful bicolorings. The number can be big enough, so print the answer modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42n) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of columns in a grid and the number of components required.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of beautiful bicolorings modulo 998244353998244353.'
