b'You have a board represented as a grid with 2\xc3\x97n2\xc3\x97n cells.'
b'The first k1k1 cells on the first row and first k2k2 cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black.'
b'You have ww white dominoes (2\xc3\x9712\xc3\x971 tiles, both cells are colored in white) and bb black dominoes (2\xc3\x9712\xc3\x971 tiles, both cells are colored in black).'
b"You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino."
b'Can you place all w+bw+b dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa430001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa43000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains three integers nn, k1k1 and k2k2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000; 0\xe2\x89\xa4k1,k2\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4k1,k2\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'The second line of each test case contains two integers ww and bb (0\xe2\x89\xa4w,b\xe2\x89\xa4n0\xe2\x89\xa4w,b\xe2\x89\xa4n).'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, print YES if it's possible to place all w+bw+b dominoes on the board and NO, otherwise."
b'You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES are all recognized as positive answer).'
