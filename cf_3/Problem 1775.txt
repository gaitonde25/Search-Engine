b"Slime and Orac are holding a turn-based game. In a big room, there are nn players sitting on the chairs, looking forward to a column and each of them is given a number: player 11 sits in the front of the column, player 22 sits directly behind him; player 33 sits directly behind player 22, and so on; player nn sits directly behind player n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921. Each player wears a hat that is either black or white. As each player faces forward, player ii knows the color of player jj's hat if and only if ii is larger than jj."
b'At the start of each turn, Orac will tell whether there exists a player wearing a black hat in the room.'
b'After Orac speaks, if the player can uniquely identify the color of his hat, he will put his hat on the chair, stand up and leave the room. All players are smart, so if it is possible to understand the color of their hat using the obtained information during this and previous rounds, they will understand it.'
b' In each turn, all players who know the color of their hats will leave at the same time in this turn, which means a player can only leave in the next turn if he gets to know the color of his hat only after someone left the room at this turn.'
b'Note that when the player needs to leave, he will put the hat on the chair before leaving, so the players ahead of him still cannot see his hat. '
b'The ii-th player will know who exactly left the room among players 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,i\xe2\x88\x9211,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,i\xe2\x88\x921, and how many players among i+1,i+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ni+1,i+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n have left the room.'
b'Slime stands outdoor. He watches the players walking out and records the numbers of the players and the time they get out. Unfortunately, Slime is so careless that he has only recorded some of the data, and this given data is in the format "player xx leaves in the yy-th round".'
b"Slime asked you to tell him the color of each player's hat. If there are multiple solutions, you can find any of them."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a integer n\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000)n\xc2\xa0(1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4200000).'
b'The second line contains nn integers t1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tn\xc2\xa0(0\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa41015)t1,t2,\xe2\x80\xa6,tn\xc2\xa0(0\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa41015). If ti=0ti=0, then there are no data about player ii; otherwise it means player ii leaves in the titi-th round.'
b'At least one solution exists for the given input. '
b'Output'
b"Print one binary string of nn characters. The ii-th character of the string should be '1' if player ii wears a black hat and should be '0', otherwise. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them."
