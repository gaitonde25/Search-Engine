b"Today's morning was exceptionally snowy. Meshanya decided to go outside and noticed a huge snowball rolling down the mountain! Luckily, there are two stones on that mountain."
b"Initially, snowball is at height hh and it has weight ww. Each second the following sequence of events happens: snowball's weights increases by ii, where ii\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 is the current height of snowball, then snowball hits the stone (if it's present at the current height), then snowball moves one meter down. If the snowball reaches height zero, it stops."
b'There are exactly two stones on the mountain. First stone has weight u1u1 and is located at height d1d1, the second one\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 u2u2 and d2d2 respectively. When the snowball hits either of two stones, it loses weight equal to the weight of that stone. If after this snowball has negative weight, then its weight becomes zero, but the snowball continues moving as before.'
b'  '
b'Find the weight of the snowball when it stops moving, that is, it reaches height\xc2\xa00.'
b'Input'
b'First line contains two integers ww and hh\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 initial weight and height of the snowball (0\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa4100; 1\xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x89\xa4100).'
b'Second line contains two integers u1u1 and d1d1\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 weight and height of the first stone (0\xe2\x89\xa4u1\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4u1\xe2\x89\xa4100; 1\xe2\x89\xa4d1\xe2\x89\xa4h1\xe2\x89\xa4d1\xe2\x89\xa4h).'
b'Third line contains two integers u2u2 and d2d2\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 weight and heigth of the second stone (0\xe2\x89\xa4u2\xe2\x89\xa41000\xe2\x89\xa4u2\xe2\x89\xa4100; 1\xe2\x89\xa4d2\xe2\x89\xa4h1\xe2\x89\xa4d2\xe2\x89\xa4h; d1\xe2\x89\xa0d2d1\xe2\x89\xa0d2). Notice that stones always have different heights.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 final weight of the snowball after it reaches height\xc2\xa00.'
