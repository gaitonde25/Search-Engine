b'There are nn points on an infinite plane. The ii-th point has coordinates (xi,yi)(xi,yi) such that xi>0xi>0 and yi>0yi>0. The coordinates are not necessarily integer.'
b'In one move you perform the following operations: '
b'  choose two points aa and bb (a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b);  move point aa from (xa,ya)(xa,ya) to either (xa+1,ya)(xa+1,ya) or (xa,ya+1)(xa,ya+1);  move point bb from (xb,yb)(xb,yb) to either (xb+1,yb)(xb+1,yb) or (xb,yb+1)(xb,yb+1);  remove points aa and bb. '
b'However, the move can only be performed if there exists a line that passes through the new coordinates of aa, new coordinates of bb and (0,0)(0,0). '
b"Otherwise, the move can't be performed and the points stay at their original coordinates (xa,ya)(xa,ya) and (xb,yb)(xb,yb), respectively."
b"The numeration of points does not change after some points are removed. Once the points are removed, they can't be chosen in any later moves. Note that you have to move both points during the move, you can't leave them at their original coordinates."
b'What is the maximum number of moves you can perform? What are these moves?'
b'If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points.'
b'The ii-th of the next nn lines contains four integers ai,bi,ci,diai,bi,ci,di (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi,ci,di\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi,ci,di\xe2\x89\xa4109). The coordinates of the ii-th point are xi=aibixi=aibi and yi=cidiyi=cidi.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print a single integer cc\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of moves you can perform.'
b"Each of the next cc lines should contain a description of a move: two integers aa and bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n, a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the points that are removed during the current move. There should be a way to move points aa and bb according to the statement so that there's a line that passes through the new coordinates of aa, the new coordinates of bb and (0,0)(0,0). No removed point can be chosen in a later move."
b'If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. You can print the moves and the points in the move in the arbitrary order.'
