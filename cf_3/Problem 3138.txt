b'Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.'
b'He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer nn. Initially the value of nn equals to vv and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer xx that x<nx<n and xx is not a divisor of nn, then subtract xx from nn. The goal of the player is to minimize the value of nn in the end.'
b'Soon, Chouti found the game trivial. Can you also beat the game?'
b'Input'
b'The input contains only one integer in the first line: vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4109), the initial value of nn.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer, the minimum value of nn the player can get.'
