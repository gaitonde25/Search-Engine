b'You are given a tree of nn vertices. You are to select kk (not necessarily distinct) simple paths in such a way that it is possible to split all edges of the tree into three sets: edges not contained in any path, edges that are a part of exactly one of these paths, and edges that are parts of all selected paths, and the latter set should be non-empty.'
b'Compute the number of ways to select kk paths modulo 998244353998244353.'
b'The paths are enumerated, in other words, two ways are considered distinct if there are such ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4k1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4k) and an edge that the ii-th path contains the edge in one way and does not contain it in the other.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of vertices in the tree and the desired number of paths.'
b'The next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describe edges of the tree. Each line contains two integers aa and bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4n, a\xe2\x89\xa0ba\xe2\x89\xa0b)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the endpoints of an edge. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'Output'
b'Print the number of ways to select kk enumerated not necessarily distinct simple paths in such a way that for each edge either it is not contained in any path, or it is contained in exactly one path, or it is contained in all kk paths, and the intersection of all paths is non-empty. '
b'As the answer can be large, print it modulo 998244353998244353.'
