b'Pasha got a very beautiful string s for his birthday, the string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The letters in the string are numbered from 1 to |s| from left to right, where |s| is the length of the given string.'
b"Pasha didn't like his present very much so he decided to change it. After his birthday Pasha spent m days performing the following transformations on his string\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0each day he chose integer ai and reversed a piece of string (a segment) from position ai to position |s|\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891. It is guaranteed that 2\xc2\xb7ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|s|."
b"You face the following task: determine what Pasha's string will look like after m days."
