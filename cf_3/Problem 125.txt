b'A wild basilisk just appeared at your doorstep. You are not entirely sure what a basilisk is and you wonder whether it evolved from your favorite animal, the weasel. '
b'How can you find out whether basilisks evolved from weasels? Certainly, a good first step is to sequence both of their DNAs. Then you can try to check whether there is a sequence of possible mutations from the DNA of the weasel to the DNA of the basilisk. '
b'Your friend Ron is a talented alchemist and has studied DNA sequences in many of his experiments. He has found out that DNA strings consist of the letters A, B and C and that single mutations can only remove or add substrings at any position in the string (a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters). The substrings that can be removed or added by a mutation are AA, BB, CC, ABAB or BCBC. During a sequence of mutations a DNA string may even become empty.'
b'Ron has agreed to sequence the DNA of the weasel and the basilisk for you, but finding out whether there is a sequence of possible mutations that leads from one to the other is too difficult for him, so you have to do it on your own. '
b'Input'
b'Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a string uu (1\xe2\x89\xa4|u|\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4|u|\xe2\x89\xa4200) \xe2\x80\x94 the DNA of the weasel.'
b'The second line of each test case contains a string vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4|v|\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4|v|\xe2\x89\xa4200) \xe2\x80\x94 the DNA of the basilisk. '
b'The values |u||u|, |v||v| denote the lengths of the strings uu and vv. It is guaranteed that both strings uu and vv consist of the letters A, B and C.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print YES if there is a sequence of mutations to get from uu to vv and NO otherwise. '
