b"When Sasha was studying in the seventh grade, he started listening to music a lot. In order to evaluate which songs he likes more, he introduced the notion of the song's prettiness. The title of the song is a word consisting of uppercase Latin letters. The prettiness of the song is the prettiness of its title."
b"Let's define the simple prettiness of a word as the ratio of the number of vowels in the word to the number of all letters in the word."
b"Let's define the prettiness of a word as the sum of simple prettiness of all the substrings of the word."
b"More formally, let's define the function vowel(c) which is equal to 1, if c is a vowel, and to 0 otherwise. Let si be the i-th character of string s, and si..j be the substring of word s, staring at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character (sisi\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891... sj, i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89j)."
b'Then the simple prettiness of s is defined by the formula:'
b''
b'The prettiness of s equals '
b''
b'Find the prettiness of the given song title.'
b'We assume that the vowels are I,\xe2\x80\x89E,\xe2\x80\x89A,\xe2\x80\x89O,\xe2\x80\x89U,\xe2\x80\x89Y.'
b'Input'
b'The input contains a single string s (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|s|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x895\xc2\xb7105) \xe2\x80\x94 the title of the song.'
b'Output'
b'Print the prettiness of the song with the absolute or relative error of at most 10\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x896.'
