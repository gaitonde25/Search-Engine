b'As you must know, the maximum clique problem in an arbitrary graph is NP-hard. Nevertheless, for some graphs of specific kinds it can be solved effectively.'
b'Just in case, let us remind you that a clique in a non-directed graph is a subset of the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of this subset are connected by an edge. In particular, an empty set of vertexes and a set consisting of a single vertex, are cliques.'
b"Let's define a divisibility graph for a set of positive integers A\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89{a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an} as follows. The vertices of the given graph are numbers from set A, and two numbers ai and aj (i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x80\x89j) are connected by an edge if and only if either ai is divisible by aj, or aj is divisible by ai."
b'You are given a set of non-negative integers A. Determine the size of a maximum clique in a divisibility graph for set A.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89106), that sets the size of set A.'
b'The second line contains n distinct positive integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89106) \xe2\x80\x94 elements of subset A. The numbers in the line follow in the ascending order.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single number \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum size of a clique in a divisibility graph for set A.'
