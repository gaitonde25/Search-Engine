b'There are nn pillars aligned in a row and numbered from 11 to nn.'
b'Initially each pillar contains exactly one disk. The ii-th pillar contains a disk having radius aiai.'
b'You can move these disks from one pillar to another. You can take a disk from pillar ii and place it on top of pillar jj if all these conditions are met:'
b'  there is no other pillar between pillars ii and jj. Formally, it means that |i\xe2\x88\x92j|=1|i\xe2\x88\x92j|=1;  pillar ii contains exactly one disk;  either pillar jj contains no disks, or the topmost disk on pillar jj has radius strictly greater than the radius of the disk you move. '
b'When you place a disk on a pillar that already has some disks on it, you put the new disk on top of previously placed disks, so the new disk will be used to check the third condition if you try to place another disk on the same pillar.'
b'You may take any disk and place it on other pillar any number of times, provided that every time you do it, all three aforementioned conditions are met. Now you wonder, is it possible to place all nn disks on the same pillar simultaneously?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (3\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pillars.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n), where aiai is the radius of the disk initially placed on the ii-th pillar. All numbers aiai are distinct.'
b'Output'
b'Print YES if it is possible to place all the disks on the same pillar simultaneously, and NO otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (YES, yes, Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO, no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).'
