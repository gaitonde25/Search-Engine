b'Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: , i.e., the value of the function is 1 if x has odd number of 1s, and 0 otherwise.'
b'Input'
b'You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:'
b' an array of qubits x (input register), a qubit y (output qubit).'
b'The operation doesn\'t have an output; the "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the qubits.'
b'Your code should have the following signature:'
b'namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : ()    {        body        {            // your code here        }    }}'
