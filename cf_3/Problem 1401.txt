b"Jett is tired after destroying the town and she wants to have a rest. She likes high places, that's why for having a rest she wants to get high and she decided to craft staircases."
b'A staircase is a squared figure that consists of square cells. Each staircase consists of an arbitrary number of stairs. If a staircase has nn stairs, then it is made of nn columns, the first column is 11 cell high, the second column is 22 cells high, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, the nn-th column if nn cells high. The lowest cells of all stairs must be in the same row.'
b'A staircase with nn stairs is called nice, if it may be covered by nn disjoint squares made of cells. All squares should fully consist of cells of a staircase.'
b' This is how a nice covered staircase with 77 stairs looks like:  '
b'Find out the maximal number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using no more than xx cells, in total. No cell can be used more than once.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)(1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The description of each test case contains a single integer xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41018)(1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41018) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of cells for building staircases.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output a single integer \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using not more than xx cells, in total.'
