b"An accordion is a string (yes, in the real world accordions are musical instruments, but let's forget about it for a while) which can be represented as a concatenation of: an opening bracket (ASCII code 091091), a colon (ASCII code 058058), some (possibly zero) vertical line characters (ASCII code 124124), another colon, and a closing bracket (ASCII code 093093). The length of the accordion is the number of characters in it."
b'For example, [::], [:||:] and [:|||:] are accordions having length 44, 66 and 77. (:|:), {:||:}, [:], ]:||:[ are not accordions. '
b'You are given a string ss. You want to transform it into an accordion by removing some (possibly zero) characters from it. Note that you may not insert new characters or reorder existing ones. Is it possible to obtain an accordion by removing characters from ss, and if so, what is the maximum possible length of the result?'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains one string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa45000001\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4500000). It consists of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], : and |.'
b'Output'
b'If it is not possible to obtain an accordion by removing some characters from ss, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921. Otherwise print maximum possible length of the resulting accordion.'
