b'Inaka has a disc, the circumference of which is nn units. The circumference is equally divided by nn points numbered clockwise from 11 to nn, such that points ii and i+1i+1 (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n1\xe2\x89\xa4i<n) are adjacent, and so are points nn and 11.'
b'There are mm straight segments on the disc, the endpoints of which are all among the aforementioned nn points.'
b'Inaka wants to know if her image is rotationally symmetrical, i.e. if there is an integer kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4k<n1\xe2\x89\xa4k<n), such that if all segments are rotated clockwise around the center of the circle by kk units, the new image will be the same as the original one.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two space-separated integers nn and mm (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa42000001\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4200000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of points and the number of segments, respectively.'
b'The ii-th of the following mm lines contains two space-separated integers aiai and bibi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ai\xe2\x89\xa0biai\xe2\x89\xa0bi) that describe a segment connecting points aiai and bibi.'
b'It is guaranteed that no segments coincide.'
b'Output'
b'Output one line\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 "Yes" if the image is rotationally symmetrical, and "No" otherwise (both excluding quotation marks).'
b'You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).'
