b'Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length nn. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing.'
b'Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are gg days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next bb days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again gg good days, bb bad days and so on.'
b'You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,g1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,g are good.'
b"You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the n=5n=5 then at least 33 units of the highway should have high quality; if n=4n=4 then at least 22 units should have high quality."
b'What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer TT (1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Next TT lines contain test cases \xe2\x80\x94 one per line. Each line contains three integers nn, gg and bb (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,g,b\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n,g,b\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the highway and the number of good and bad days respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Print TT integers \xe2\x80\x94 one per test case. For each test case, print the minimum number of days required to repair the whole highway if at least half of it should have high quality.'
