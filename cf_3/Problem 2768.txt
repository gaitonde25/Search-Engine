b"Neko is playing with his toys on the backyard of Aki's house. Aki decided to play a prank on him, by secretly putting catnip into Neko's toys. Unfortunately, he went overboard and put an entire bag of catnip into the toys..."
b'It took Neko an entire day to turn back to normal. Neko reported to Aki that he saw a lot of weird things, including a trie of all correct bracket sequences of length 2n2n.'
b'The definition of correct bracket sequence is as follows:'
b'  The empty sequence is a correct bracket sequence,  If ss is a correct bracket sequence, then (s)(s) is a correct bracket sequence,  If ss and tt are a correct bracket sequence, then stst is also a correct bracket sequence. '
b'For example, the strings "(())", "()()" form a correct bracket sequence, while ")(" and "((" not.'
b'Aki then came up with an interesting problem: What is the size of the maximum matching (the largest set of edges such that there are no two edges with a common vertex) in this trie? Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.'
b'Input'
b'The only line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000).'
b'Output'
b'Print exactly one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the size of the maximum matching in the trie. Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.'
