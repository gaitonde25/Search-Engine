b'Alice and Bob are playing a game. '
b"They start with a positive integer nn and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from nn one of its divisors that isn't 11 or nn. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first."
b'Note that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn.'
b'You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'Each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the initial number.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case output "Alice" if Alice will win the game or "Bob" if Bob will win, if both players play optimally.'
