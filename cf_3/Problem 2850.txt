b'Polycarp is a head of a circus troupe. There are nn\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 an even number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 artists in the troupe. It is known whether the ii-th artist can perform as a clown (if yes, then ci=1ci=1, otherwise ci=0ci=0), and whether they can perform as an acrobat (if yes, then ai=1ai=1, otherwise ai=0ai=0).'
b'Split the artists into two performances in such a way that: '
b'  each artist plays in exactly one performance,  the number of artists in the two performances is equal (i.e. equal to n2n2),  the number of artists that can perform as clowns in the first performance is the same as the number of artists that can perform as acrobats in the second performance. '
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000, nn is even)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of artists in the troupe.'
b'The second line contains nn digits c1c2\xe2\x80\xa6cnc1c2\xe2\x80\xa6cn, the ii-th of which is equal to 11 if the ii-th artist can perform as a clown, and 00 otherwise.'
b'The third line contains nn digits a1a2\xe2\x80\xa6ana1a2\xe2\x80\xa6an, the ii-th of which is equal to 11, if the ii-th artist can perform as an acrobat, and 00 otherwise.'
b'Output'
b'Print n2n2 distinct integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the indices of the artists that should play in the first performance.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any.'
b'If there is no solution, print a single integer \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921.'
