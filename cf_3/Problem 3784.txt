b"Firecrackers scare Nian the monster, but they're wayyyyy too noisy! Maybe fireworks make a nice complement."
b"Little Tommy is watching a firework show. As circular shapes spread across the sky, a splendid view unfolds on the night of Lunar New Year's eve."
b'A wonder strikes Tommy. How many regions are formed by the circles on the sky? We consider the sky as a flat plane. A region is a connected part of the plane with positive area, whose bound consists of parts of bounds of the circles and is a curve or several curves without self-intersections, and that does not contain any curve other than its boundaries. Note that exactly one of the regions extends infinitely.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input contains one integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x893), denoting the number of circles.'
b'The following n lines each contains three space-separated integers x, y and r (\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x8910\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89x,\xe2\x80\x89y\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910, 1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89r\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8910), describing a circle whose center is (x,\xe2\x80\x89y) and the radius is r. No two circles have the same x, y and r at the same time.'
b'Output'
b'Print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of regions on the plane.'
