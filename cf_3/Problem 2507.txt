b'You are on the island which can be represented as a n\xc3\x97mn\xc3\x97m table. The rows are numbered from 11 to nn and the columns are numbered from 11 to mm. There are kk treasures on the island, the ii-th of them is located at the position (ri,ci)(ri,ci).'
b"Initially you stand at the lower left corner of the island, at the position (1,1)(1,1). If at any moment you are at the cell with a treasure, you can pick it up without any extra time. In one move you can move up (from (r,c)(r,c) to (r+1,c)(r+1,c)), left (from (r,c)(r,c) to (r,c\xe2\x88\x921)(r,c\xe2\x88\x921)), or right (from position (r,c)(r,c) to (r,c+1)(r,c+1)). Because of the traps, you can't move down."
b'However, moving up is also risky. You can move up only if you are in a safe column. There are qq safe columns: b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bqb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bq. You want to collect all the treasures as fast as possible. Count the minimum number of moves required to collect all the treasures.'
