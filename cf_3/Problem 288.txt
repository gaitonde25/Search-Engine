b'Note: The XOR-sum of set {s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sm}{s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sm} is defined as s1\xe2\x8a\x95s2\xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8a\x95sms1\xe2\x8a\x95s2\xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8a\x95sm, where \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.'
b'After almost winning IOI, Victor bought himself an n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n grid containing integers in each cell. nn is an even integer. The integer in the cell in the ii-th row and jj-th column is ai,jai,j.'
b'Sadly, Mihai stole the grid from Victor and told him he would return it with only one condition: Victor has to tell Mihai the XOR-sum of all the integers in the whole grid.'
b"Victor doesn't remember all the elements of the grid, but he remembers some information about it: For each cell, Victor remembers the XOR-sum of all its neighboring cells."
b'Two cells are considered neighbors if they share an edge \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, for some integers 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j,k,l\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j,k,l\xe2\x89\xa4n, the cell in the ii-th row and jj-th column is a neighbor of the cell in the kk-th row and ll-th column if |i\xe2\x88\x92k|=1|i\xe2\x88\x92k|=1 and j=lj=l, or if i=ki=k and |j\xe2\x88\x92l|=1|j\xe2\x88\x92l|=1.'
b'To get his grid back, Victor is asking you for your help. Can you use the information Victor remembers to find the XOR-sum of the whole grid?'
b'It can be proven that the answer is unique.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single even integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the grid.'
b'Then follows nn lines, each containing nn integers. The jj-th integer in the ii-th of these lines represents the XOR-sum of the integers in all the neighbors of the cell in the ii-th row and jj-th column.'
b"It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 10001000 and in the original grid 0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x921."
b'Hack Format'
b'To hack a solution, use the following format:'
b'The first line should contain a single integer t (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case should contain a single even integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the grid.'
b"Then nn lines should follow, each containing nn integers. The jj-th integer in the ii-th of these lines is ai,jai,j in Victor's original grid. The values in the grid should be integers in the range [0,230\xe2\x88\x921][0,230\xe2\x88\x921]"
b'The sum of nn over all test cases must not exceed 10001000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, output a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the XOR-sum of the whole grid.'
