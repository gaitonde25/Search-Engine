b'Your task is to determine the maximum possible efficiency of the workgroup formed at observing the given condition. Any person including the director of company can enter the workgroup.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains integer n (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892\xc2\xb7105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of workers of the Big Software Company. '
b"Then n lines follow, describing the company employees.
