b'You work as a system administrator in a dormitory, which has nn rooms one after another along a straight hallway. Rooms are numbered from 11 to nn.'
b'You have to connect all nn rooms to the Internet.'
b'You can connect each room to the Internet directly, the cost of such connection for the ii-th room is ii coins. '
b'Some rooms also have a spot for a router. The cost of placing a router in the ii-th room is also ii coins. You cannot place a router in a room which does not have a spot for it. When you place a router in the room ii, you connect all rooms with the numbers from max(1,\xc2\xa0i\xe2\x88\x92k)max(1,\xc2\xa0i\xe2\x88\x92k) to min(n,\xc2\xa0i+k)min(n,\xc2\xa0i+k) inclusive to the Internet, where kk is the range of router. The value of kk is the same for all routers. '
b'Calculate the minimum total cost of connecting all nn rooms to the Internet. You can assume that the number of rooms which have a spot for a router is not greater than the number of routers you have.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers nn and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n,k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rooms and the range of each router.'
b"The second line of the input contains one string ss of length nn, consisting only of zeros and ones. If the ii-th character of the string equals to '1' then there is a spot for a router in the ii-th room. If the ii-th character of the string equals to '0' then you cannot place a router in the ii-th room."
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum total cost of connecting all nn rooms to the Internet.'
