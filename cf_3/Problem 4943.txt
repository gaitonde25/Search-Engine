b"During the programming classes Vasya was assigned a difficult problem. However, he doesn't know how to code and was unable to find the solution in the Internet, so he asks you to help."
b'You are given a sequence aa, consisting of nn distinct integers, that is used to construct the binary search tree. Below is the formal description of the construction process.'
b'  First element a1a1 becomes the root of the tree.  Elements a2,a3,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana2,a3,\xe2\x80\xa6,an are added one by one. To add element aiai one needs to traverse the tree starting from the root and using the following rules:   The pointer to the current node is set to the root.  If aiai is greater than the value in the current node, then its right child becomes the current node. Otherwise, the left child of the current node becomes the new current node.  If at some point there is no required child, the new node is created, it is assigned value aiai and becomes the corresponding child of the current node.  '
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the sequence aa.'
b'The second line contains nn distinct integers aiai (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the sequence aa itself.'
b'Output'
b'Output n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 integers. For all i>1i>1 print the value written in the node that is the parent of the node with value aiai in it.'
