b'Sasha likes investigating different math objects, for example, magic squares. But Sasha understands that magic squares have already been studied by hundreds of people, so he sees no sense of studying them further. Instead, he invented his own type of square\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a prime square. '
b'A square of size n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n is called prime if the following three conditions are held simultaneously: '
b'  all numbers on the square are non-negative integers not exceeding 105105;  there are no prime numbers in the square;  sums of integers in each row and each column are prime numbers. '
b'Sasha has an integer nn. He asks you to find any prime square of size n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n. Sasha is absolutely sure such squares exist, so just help him!'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'Each of the next tt lines contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the required size of a square.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print nn lines, each containing nn integers\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the prime square you built. If there are multiple answers, print any.'
