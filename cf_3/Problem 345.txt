b"The Hat is a game of speedy explanation/guessing words (similar to Alias). It's fun. Try it! In this problem, we are talking about a variant of the game when the players are sitting at the table and everyone plays individually (i.e. not teams, but individual gamers play)."
b'nn people gathered in a room with mm tables (n\xe2\x89\xa52mn\xe2\x89\xa52m). They want to play the Hat kk times. Thus, kk games will be played at each table. Each player will play in kk games.'
b'To do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.'
b'Players want to have the most "fair" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that:'
b"  At any table in each game there are either \xe2\x8c\x8anm\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8anm\xe2\x8c\x8b people or \xe2\x8c\x88nm\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88nm\xe2\x8c\x89 people (that is, either n/mn/m rounded down, or n/mn/m rounded up). Different numbers of people can play different games at the same table. Let's calculate for each player the value bibi \xe2\x80\x94 the number of times the ii-th player played at a table with \xe2\x8c\x88nm\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x8c\x88nm\xe2\x8c\x89 persons (n/mn/m rounded up). Any two values of bibimust differ by no more than 11. In other words, for any two players ii and jj, it must be true |bi\xe2\x88\x92bj|\xe2\x89\xa41|bi\xe2\x88\x92bj|\xe2\x89\xa41. "
b'For example, if n=5n=5, m=2m=2 and k=2k=2, then at the request of the first item either two players or three players should play at each table. Consider the following schedules:'
b'  First game: 1,2,31,2,3 are played at the first table, and 4,54,5 at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play 5,15,1, and at the second \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 2,3,42,3,4. This schedule is not "fair" since b2=2b2=2 (the second player played twice at a big table) and b5=0b5=0 (the fifth player did not play at a big table). First game: 1,2,31,2,3 are played at the first table, and 4,54,5 at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play 4,5,24,5,2, and at the second one \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 1,31,3. This schedule is "fair": b=[1,2,1,1,1]b=[1,2,1,1,1] (any two values of bibi differ by no more than 11). '
b'Find any "fair" game schedule for nn people if they play on the mm tables of kk games.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the test.'
b'Each test case consists of one line that contains three integers nn, mm and kk (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x8c\x8an2\xe2\x8c\x8b1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x8c\x8an2\xe2\x8c\x8b, 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of people, tables and games, respectively.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nknk (nn multiplied by kk) over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a required schedule \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 a sequence of kk blocks of mm lines. Each block corresponds to one game, a line in a block corresponds to one table. In each line print the number of players at the table and the indices of the players (numbers from 11 to nn) who should play at this table.'
b'If there are several required schedules, then output any of them. We can show that a valid solution always exists.'
b'You can output additional blank lines to separate responses to different sets of inputs.'
