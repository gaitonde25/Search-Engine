b'You are given an integer array of length nn.'
b'You have to choose some subsequence of this array of maximum length such that this subsequence forms a increasing sequence of consecutive integers. In other words the required sequence should be equal to [x,x+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,x+k\xe2\x88\x921][x,x+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,x+k\xe2\x88\x921] for some value xx and length kk.'
b'Subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. You can erase any elements, not necessarily going successively. The remaining elements preserve their order. For example, for the array [5,3,1,2,4][5,3,1,2,4] the following arrays are subsequences: [3][3], [5,3,1,2,4][5,3,1,2,4], [5,1,4][5,1,4], but the array [1,3][1,3] is not.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input containing integer number nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the array. The second line of the input containing nn integer numbers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the array itself.'
b'Output'
b'On the first line print kk \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum length of the subsequence of the given array that forms an increasing sequence of consecutive integers.'
b'On the second line print the sequence of the indices of the any maximum length subsequence of the given array that forms an increasing sequence of consecutive integers.'
