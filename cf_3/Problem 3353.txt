b"You have a set of nn weights. You know that their masses are a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan grams, but you don't know which of them has which mass. You can't distinguish the weights."
b'However, your friend does know the mass of each weight. You can ask your friend to give you exactly kk weights with the total mass mm (both parameters kk and mm are chosen by you), and your friend will point to any valid subset of weights, if it is possible.'
b'You are allowed to make this query only once. Find the maximum possible number of weights you can reveal after this query.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of weights.'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the masses of the weights.'
b'Output'
b'Print the maximum number of weights you can learn the masses for after making a single query.'
