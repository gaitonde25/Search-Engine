b'You are standing on the OXOX-axis at point 00 and you want to move to an integer point x>0x>0.'
b"You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point yy (yy may be negative) and jump for the kk-th time. You can: "
b'  either jump to the point y+ky+k  or jump to the point y\xe2\x88\x921y\xe2\x88\x921. '
b'What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point xx?'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4106)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the destination point.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print the single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of jumps to reach xx. It can be proved that we can reach any integer point xx.'
