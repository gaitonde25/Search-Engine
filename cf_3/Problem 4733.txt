b"Polycarp is a music editor at the radio station. He received a playlist for tomorrow, that can be represented as a sequence a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an, where ai is a band, which performs the i-th song. Polycarp likes bands with the numbers from 1 to m, but he doesn't really like others. "
b'We define as bj the number of songs the group j is going to perform tomorrow. Polycarp wants to change the playlist in such a way that the minimum among the numbers b1,\xe2\x80\x89b2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89bm will be as large as possible.'
b'Find this maximum possible value of the minimum among the bj (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89j\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m), and the minimum number of changes in the playlist Polycarp needs to make to achieve it. One change in the playlist is a replacement of the performer of the i-th song with any other group.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x892000).'
b'The second line contains n integers a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89an (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ai\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89109), where ai is the performer of the i-th song.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print two integers: the maximum possible value of the minimum among the bj (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89j\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m), where bj is the number of songs in the changed playlist performed by the j-th band, and the minimum number of changes in the playlist Polycarp needs to make.'
b'In the second line print the changed playlist.'
b'If there are multiple answers, print any of them.'
