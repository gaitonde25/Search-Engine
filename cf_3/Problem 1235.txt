b'You are asked to watch your nephew who likes to play with toy blocks in a strange way.'
b'He has nn boxes and the ii-th box has aiai blocks. His game consists of two steps: '
b'  he chooses an arbitrary box ii;  he tries to move all blocks from the ii-th box to other boxes. '
b' If he can make the same number of blocks in each of '

b' other boxes then he will be happy, otherwise, will be sad. Note that your nephew can only move the blocks from the chosen box to the other boxes; he cannot move blocks from the other boxes.'
b"You don't want to make your nephew sad, so you decided to put several extra blocks into some boxes in such a way that no matter which box ii he chooses he won't be sad. What is the minimum number of extra blocks you need to put?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains the integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of boxes.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of blocks in each box.'
b"It's guaranteed that the sum of nn over test cases doesn't exceed 105105."
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of blocks you need to put. It can be proved that the answer always exists, i.\xc2\xa0e. the number of blocks is finite.'
