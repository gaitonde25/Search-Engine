b'There is a famous olympiad, which has more than a hundred participants. The Olympiad consists of two stages: the elimination stage, and the final stage. At least a hundred participants will advance to the final stage. The elimination stage in turn consists of two contests.'
b'A result of the elimination stage is the total score in two contests, but, unfortunately, the jury lost the final standings and has only standings for the first and for the second contest separately. '
b'In each contest, the participants are ranked by their point score in non-increasing order. When two participants have a tie (earned the same score), they are ranked by their passport number (in accordance with local regulations, all passport numbers are distinct). '
b'In the first contest, the participant on the 100-th place scored aa points. Also, the jury checked all participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place (inclusive) in the first contest and found out that all of them have at least bb points in the second contest.'
b'Similarly, for the second contest, the participant on the 100-th place has cc points. And the jury checked that all the participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place (inclusive) have at least dd points in the first contest.'
b'After two contests, all participants are ranked by their total score in two contests in non-increasing order. When participants have the same total score, tie-breaking with passport numbers is used. The cutoff score to qualify to the final stage is the total score of the participant on the 100-th place.'
b'Given integers aa, bb, cc, dd, please help the jury determine the smallest possible value of the cutoff score.'
b'Input'
b'You need to process tt test cases.'
b'The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa430251\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa43025)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then descriptions of tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains four integers aa, bb, cc, dd (0\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c,d\xe2\x89\xa490\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c,d\xe2\x89\xa49; d\xe2\x89\xa4ad\xe2\x89\xa4a; b\xe2\x89\xa4cb\xe2\x89\xa4c). '
b'One can show that for any test case satisfying the constraints above, there is at least one olympiad scenario possible.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print a single integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the smallest possible cutoff score in some olympiad scenario satisfying the given information.'
