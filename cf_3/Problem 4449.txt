b'In this problem you will write a simple generator of Brainfuck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) calculators.'
b'You are given an arithmetic expression consisting of integers from 0 to 255 and addition/subtraction signs between them. Output a Brainfuck program which, when executed, will print the result of evaluating this expression.'
b'We use a fairly standard Brainfuck interpreter for checking the programs:'
b" 30000 memory cells. memory cells store integers from 0 to 255 with unsigned 8-bit wraparound. console input (, command) is not supported, but it's not needed for this problem."
b'Input'
b'The only line of input data contains the arithmetic expression. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus. Each operand will be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive. The calculations result is guaranteed to be an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive (results of intermediary calculations might be outside of these boundaries).'
b'Output'
b'Output a Brainfuck program which, when executed, will print the result of evaluating this expression. The program must be at most 5000000 characters long (including the non-command characters), and its execution must be complete in at most 50000000 steps.'
