b'A group of n friends enjoys playing popular video game Toda 2. There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the i-th friend is ri.'
b'The friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all n friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.'
b"One way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than n) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so ri\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890 doesn't change after losing."
b'The friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members).'
b'The friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.'
b'Help the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer n (2\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of friends.'
b'The second line contains n non-negative integers r1,\xe2\x80\x89r2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89rn (0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89ri\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100), where ri is the initial rating of the i-th friend.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line, print a single integer R \xe2\x80\x94 the final rating of each of the friends.'
b"In the second line, print integer t \xe2\x80\x94 the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following t lines should contain n characters '0' or '1', where the j-th character of the i-th line is equal to:"
b"  '0', if friend j should not play in match i,  '1', if friend j should play in match i. "
b"Each line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive."
b'The value t should not exceed 104, it is guaranteed that such solution exists. '
b"Remember that you shouldn't minimize the value t, but you should maximize R. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them."
