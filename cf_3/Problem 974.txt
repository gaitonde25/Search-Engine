b'This is an interactive problem.'
b'Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is n\xc3\x97nn\xc3\x97n grid, initially empty. We refer to the cell in row ii and column jj by (i,j)(i,j) for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n. There is an infinite supply of tokens that come in 33 colors labelled 11, 22, and 33.'
b"The game proceeds with turns as follows. Each turn begins with Alice naming one of the three colors, let's call it aa. Then, Bob chooses a color b\xe2\x89\xa0ab\xe2\x89\xa0a, chooses an empty cell, and places a token of color bb on that cell."
b'We say that there is a conflict if there exist two adjacent cells containing tokens of the same color. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common edge.'
b'If at any moment there is a conflict, Alice wins. Otherwise, if n2n2 turns are completed (so that the grid becomes full) without any conflicts, Bob wins.'
b'We have a proof that Bob has a winning strategy. Play the game as Bob and win.'
b"The interactor is adaptive. That is, Alice's color choices can depend on Bob's previous moves."
