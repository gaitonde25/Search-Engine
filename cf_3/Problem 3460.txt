b'In a simplified version of a "Mini Metro" game, there is only one subway line, and all the trains go in the same direction. There are nn stations on the line, aiai people are waiting for the train at the ii-th station at the beginning of the game. The game starts at the beginning of the 00-th hour. At the end of each hour (couple minutes before the end of the hour), bibi people instantly arrive to the ii-th station. If at some moment, the number of people at the ii-th station is larger than cici, you lose.'
b'A player has several trains which he can appoint to some hours. The capacity of each train is kk passengers. In the middle of the appointed hour, the train goes from the 11-st to the nn-th station, taking as many people at each station as it can accommodate. A train can not take people from the ii-th station if there are people at the i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921-th station.'
b'If multiple trains are appointed to the same hour, their capacities are being added up and they are moving together.'
b'The player wants to stay in the game for tt hours. Determine the minimum number of trains he will need for it.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains three integers nn, tt, and kk (1\xe2\x89\xa4n,t\xe2\x89\xa4200,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4n,t\xe2\x89\xa4200,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of stations on the line, hours we want to survive, and capacity of each train respectively.'
b'Each of the next nn lines contains three integers aiai, bibi, and cici (0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41090\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 number of people at the ii-th station in the beginning of the game, number of people arriving to ii-th station in the end of each hour and maximum number of people at the ii-th station allowed respectively.'
b'Output'
b'Output a single integer number\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the answer to the problem.'
