b'You are given an array of nn integers. You need to split all integers into two groups so that the GCD of all integers in the first group is equal to one and the GCD of all integers in the second group is equal to one.'
b'The GCD of a group of integers is the largest non-negative integer that divides all the integers in the group.'
b'Both groups have to be non-empty.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105).'
b'The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6, anan (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array.'
b'Output'
b'In the first line print "YES" (without quotes), if it is possible to split the integers into two groups as required, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.'
b'If it is possible to split the integers, in the second line print nn integers, where the ii-th integer is equal to 11 if the integer aiai should be in the first group, and 22 otherwise.'
b'If there are multiple solutions, print any.'
