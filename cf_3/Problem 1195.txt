b'Polycarp has a favorite sequence a[1\xe2\x80\xa6n]a[1\xe2\x80\xa6n] consisting of nn integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:'
b'  he wrote the number a1a1 to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);  he wrote the number a2a2 to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard);  then as far to the left as possible (but to the right from a1a1), he wrote the number a3a3;  then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from a2a2), he wrote the number a4a4;  Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard. '
b'  The beginning of the result looks like this (of course, if n\xe2\x89\xa54n\xe2\x89\xa54). '
b'For example, if n=7n=7 and a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2]a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2], then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard [3,4,5,2,9,1,1][3,4,5,2,9,1,1].'
b"You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence."
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single positive integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa43001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4300)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases in the test. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa43001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4300)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the sequence written on the whiteboard.'
b'The next line contains nn integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the sequence written on the whiteboard.'
b'Output'
b'Output tt answers to the test cases. Each answer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 is a sequence aa that Polycarp wrote out on the whiteboard.'
