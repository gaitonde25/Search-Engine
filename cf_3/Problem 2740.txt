b'You have a bag which contains nn cards. There is a number written on each card; the number on ii-th card is aiai.'
b'You are playing the following game. During each turn, you choose and remove a random card from the bag (all cards that are still left inside the bag are chosen equiprobably). Nothing else happens during the first turn \xe2\x80\x94 but during the next turns, after removing a card (let the number on it be xx), you compare it with the card that was removed during the previous turn (let the number on it be yy). Possible outcomes are: '
b'  if x<yx<y, the game ends and you lose;  if x=yx=y, the game ends and you win;  if x>yx>y, the game continues. '
b'If there are no cards left in the bag, you lose. Cards are not returned into the bag after you remove them.'
b'You have to calculate the probability of winning in this game. It can be shown that it is in the form of PQPQ where PP and QQ are non-negative integers and Q\xe2\x89\xa00Q\xe2\x89\xa00, P\xe2\x89\xa4QP\xe2\x89\xa4Q. Output the value of P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0(mod\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0998244353)P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921\xc2\xa0(mod\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0998244353).'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains one integer nn (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450002\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cards in the bag.'
b'The second live contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the ii-th integer is the number written on the ii-th card. '
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the probability of winning in this game modulo 998244353998244353.'
