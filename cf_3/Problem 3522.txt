b'There are nn cities and mm roads in Berland. Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.'
b'What is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?'
b'New roads will also be one-way.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of input consists of three integers nn, mm and ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000,0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa45000,1\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa45000,0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa45000,1\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4n) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from 11 to nn.'
b'The following mm lines contain roads: road ii is given as a pair of cities uiui, vivi (1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4n, ui\xe2\x89\xa0viui\xe2\x89\xa0vi). For each pair of cities (u,v)(u,v), there can be at most one road from uu to vv. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from uu to vv and from vv to uu).'
b'Output'
b'Print one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city ss. If all the cities are already reachable from ss, print 0.'
