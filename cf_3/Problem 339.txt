b'One day, early in the morning, you decided to buy yourself a bag of chips in the nearby store. The store has chips of nn different flavors. A bag of the ii-th flavor costs aiai burles.'
b"The store may run out of some flavors, so you'll decide which one to buy after arriving there. But there are two major flaws in this plan: "
b"  you have only coins of 11, 22 and 33 burles;  since it's morning, the store will ask you to pay in exact change, i.\xc2\xa0e. if you choose the ii-th flavor, you'll have to pay exactly aiai burles. "
b"Coins are heavy, so you'd like to take the least possible number of coins in total. That's why you are wondering: what is the minimum total number of coins you should take with you, so you can buy a bag of chips of any flavor in exact change?"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The first line of each test case contains the single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of flavors in the store.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the cost of one bag of each flavor.'
b'Output'
b"For each test case, print one integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of coins you need to buy one bag of any flavor you'll choose in exact change."
