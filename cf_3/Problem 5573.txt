b'Vitaly is a diligent student who never missed a lesson in his five years of studying in the university. He always does his homework on time and passes his exams in time. '
b'During the last lesson the teacher has provided two strings s and t to Vitaly. The strings have the same length, they consist of lowercase English letters, string s is lexicographically smaller than string t. Vitaly wondered if there is such string that is lexicographically larger than string s and at the same is lexicographically smaller than string t. This string should also consist of lowercase English letters and have the length equal to the lengths of strings s and t. '
b"Let's help Vitaly solve this easy problem!"
b'Input'
b'The first line contains string s (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89|s|\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89100), consisting of lowercase English letters. Here, |s| denotes the length of the string.'
b'The second line contains string t (|t|\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89|s|), consisting of lowercase English letters.'
b'It is guaranteed that the lengths of strings s and t are the same and string s is lexicographically less than string t.'
b'Output'
b'If the string that meets the given requirements doesn\'t exist, print a single string "No such string" (without the quotes).'
b'If such string exists, print it. If there are multiple valid strings, you may print any of them.'
