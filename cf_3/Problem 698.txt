b'The Olympic Games have just started and Federico is eager to watch the marathon race.'
b'There will be nn athletes, numbered from 11 to nn, competing in the marathon, and all of them have taken part in 55 important marathons, numbered from 11 to 55, in the past. For each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa45, Federico remembers that athlete ii ranked ri,jri,j-th in marathon jj (e.g., r2,4=3r2,4=3 means that athlete 22 was third in marathon 44).'
b'Federico considers athlete xx superior to athlete yy if athlete xx ranked better than athlete yy in at least 33 past marathons, i.e., rx,j<ry,jrx,j<ry,j for at least 33 distinct values of jj.'
b'Federico believes that an athlete is likely to get the gold medal at the Olympics if he is superior to all other athletes.'
b'Find any athlete who is likely to get the gold medal (that is, an athlete who is superior to all other athletes), or determine that there is no such athlete.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4500001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa450000) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of athletes.'
b'Then nn lines follow, each describing the ranking positions of one athlete.'
b'The ii-th of these lines contains the 55 integers ri,1,ri,2,ri,3,ri,4,ri,5ri,1,ri,2,ri,3,ri,4,ri,5 (1\xe2\x89\xa4ri,j\xe2\x89\xa4500001\xe2\x89\xa4ri,j\xe2\x89\xa450000) \xe2\x80\x94 the ranking positions of athlete ii in the past 55 marathons. It is guaranteed that, in each of the 55 past marathons, the nn athletes have distinct ranking positions, i.e., for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa45, the nn values r1,j,r2,j,\xe2\x80\xa6,rn,jr1,j,r2,j,\xe2\x80\xa6,rn,j are distinct.'
b'It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 5000050000.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of an athlete who is likely to get the gold medal (that is, an athlete who is superior to all other athletes). If there are no such athletes, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921. If there is more than such one athlete, print any of them.'
