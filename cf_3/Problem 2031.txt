b'Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has ss burles on his card. '
b'Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4s1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4s, buy food that costs exactly xx burles and obtain \xe2\x8c\x8ax10\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8ax10\xe2\x8c\x8b burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends xx burles and obtains \xe2\x8c\x8ax10\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8ax10\xe2\x8c\x8b back). The operation \xe2\x8c\x8aab\xe2\x8c\x8b\xe2\x8c\x8aab\xe2\x8c\x8b means aa divided by bb rounded down.'
b'It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs xx for any possible value of xx.'
b'Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.'
b'For example, if Mishka has s=19s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 2121. Firstly, he can spend x=10x=10 burles, obtain 11 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10s=10 burles, so can spend x=10x=10 burles, obtain 11 burle as a cashback and spend it too.'
b'You have to answer tt independent test cases.'
b'Input'
b'The first line of the input contains one integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4104) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.'
b'The next tt lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4109) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of burles Mishka initially has.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case print the answer on it \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.'
