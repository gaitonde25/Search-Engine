b'There is a rectangular grid of n rows of m initially-white cells each.'
b'Arkady performed a certain number (possibly zero) of operations on it. In the i-th operation, a non-empty subset of rows Ri and a non-empty subset of columns Ci are chosen. For each row r in Ri and each column c in Ci, the intersection of row r and column c is coloured black.'
b"There's another constraint: a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. In other words, it means that no pair of (i,\xe2\x80\x89j) (i\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89j) exists such that  or , where  denotes intersection of sets, and  denotes the empty set."
b'You are to determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that produces a given final grid.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n,\xe2\x80\x89m\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x8950)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively.'
b"Each of the following n lines contains a string of m characters, each being either '.' (denoting a white cell) or '#' (denoting a black cell), representing the desired setup."
b'Output'
b'If the given grid can be achieved by any valid sequence of operations, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes).'
b'You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).'
