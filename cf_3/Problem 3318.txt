b'You are given a binary string ss.'
b'Find the number of distinct cyclical binary strings of length nn which contain ss as a substring.'
b'The cyclical string tt contains ss as a substring if there is some cyclical shift of string tt, such that ss is a substring of this cyclical shift of tt.'
b'For example, the cyclical string "000111" contains substrings "001", "01110" and "10", but doesn\'t contain "0110" and "10110".'
b'Two cyclical strings are called different if they differ from each other as strings. For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4401\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa440)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the length of the target string tt.'
b"The next line contains the string ss (1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4n)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the string which must be a substring of cyclical string tt. String ss contains only characters '0' and '1'."
b'Output'
b'Print the only integer\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of distinct cyclical binary strings tt, which contain ss as a substring.'
