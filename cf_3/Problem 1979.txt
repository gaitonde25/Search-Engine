b'Kuroni has nn daughters. As gifts for them, he bought nn necklaces and nn bracelets:'
b'  the ii-th necklace has a brightness aiai, where all the aiai are pairwise distinct (i.e. all aiai are different),  the ii-th bracelet has a brightness bibi, where all the bibi are pairwise distinct (i.e. all bibi are different). '
b'Kuroni wants to give exactly one necklace and exactly one bracelet to each of his daughters. To make sure that all of them look unique, the total brightnesses of the gifts given to each daughter should be pairwise distinct. Formally, if the ii-th daughter receives a necklace with brightness xixi and a bracelet with brightness yiyi, then the sums xi+yixi+yi should be pairwise distinct. Help Kuroni to distribute the gifts.'
b'For example, if the brightnesses are a=[1,7,5]a=[1,7,5] and b=[6,1,2]b=[6,1,2], then we may distribute the gifts as follows:'
b'  Give the third necklace and the first bracelet to the first daughter, for a total brightness of a3+b1=11a3+b1=11. Give the first necklace and the third bracelet to the second daughter, for a total brightness of a1+b3=3a1+b3=3. Give the second necklace and the second bracelet to the third daughter, for a total brightness of a2+b2=8a2+b2=8. '
b'Here is an example of an invalid distribution: '
b'  Give the first necklace and the first bracelet to the first daughter, for a total brightness of a1+b1=7a1+b1=7. Give the second necklace and the second bracelet to the second daughter, for a total brightness of a2+b2=8a2+b2=8. Give the third necklace and the third bracelet to the third daughter, for a total brightness of a3+b3=7a3+b3=7. '
b"This distribution is invalid, as the total brightnesses of the gifts received by the first and the third daughter are the same. Don't make them this upset!"
b'Input'
b'The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.'
b'The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the number of daughters, necklaces and bracelets.'
b'The second line of each test case contains nn distinct integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,an (1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the brightnesses of the necklaces.'
b'The third line of each test case contains nn distinct integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn (1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41000) \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 the brightnesses of the bracelets.'
b'Output'
b'For each test case, print a line containing nn integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xnx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn, representing that the ii-th daughter receives a necklace with brightness xixi. In the next line print nn integers y1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yny1,y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,yn, representing that the ii-th daughter receives a bracelet with brightness yiyi.'
b'The sums x1+y1,x2+y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn+ynx1+y1,x2+y2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn+yn should all be distinct. The numbers x1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xnx1,\xe2\x80\xa6,xn should be equal to the numbers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ana1,\xe2\x80\xa6,an in some order, and the numbers y1,\xe2\x80\xa6,yny1,\xe2\x80\xa6,yn should be equal to the numbers b1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bnb1,\xe2\x80\xa6,bn in some order. '
b'It can be shown that an answer always exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.'
