b'Nauuo is a girl who loves traveling.'
b'One day she went to a tree, Old Driver Tree, literally, a tree with an old driver on it.'
b"The tree is a connected graph consisting of nn nodes and n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 edges. Each node has a color, and Nauuo will visit the ODT through a simple path on the tree in the old driver's car."
b"Nauuo wants to visit see more different colors in her journey, but she doesn't know which simple path she will be traveling on. So, she wants to calculate the sum of the numbers of different colors on all different paths. Can you help her?"
b"What's more, the ODT is being redecorated, so there will be mm modifications, each modification will change a single node's color. Nauuo wants to know the answer after each modification too."
b'Note that in this problem, we consider the simple path from uu to vv and the simple path from vv to uu as two different simple paths if and only if u\xe2\x89\xa0vu\xe2\x89\xa0v.'
b'Input'
b'The first line contains two integers nn and mm (2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105, 1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105) \xe2\x80\x94 the number of nodes and the number of modifications.'
b'The second line contains nn integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cnc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cn (1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4n), where cici is the initial color of node ii.'
b'Each of the next n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers uu and vv (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n), denoting there is an edge between uu and vv. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.'
b'Each of the next mm lines contains two integers uu and xx (1\xe2\x89\xa4u,x\xe2\x89\xa4n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,x\xe2\x89\xa4n), which means a modification that changes the color of node uu into xx.'
b'Output'
b'The output contains m+1m+1 integers \xe2\x80\x94 the first integer is the answer at the beginning, the rest integers are the answers after every modification in the given order.'
